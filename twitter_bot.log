Seriously, kudos to the devs for managing to salvage the talent system into something cool.

I know people were furious when hero mode was canceled, but I've always been extremely skeptical about how hero mode was going to stay fun. We already had a taste of what hero mode was going to be (sans talents) with the Underworld event and it was fucking boring as all hell. It was so boring that I will bet that 90% of those reading this probably does not even remember what it was. Adding a grindy treadmill in the form of WoW talents would not have fundamentally improved the experience.

I greatly prefer the way Stadium looks from the outset and I frankly find it far more fun to have a Heroes of the Storm style talent build that remains dynamic throughout the match than the static WoW style tree.
