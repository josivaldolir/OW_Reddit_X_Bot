2025-02-22 15:13:21,017 - INFO - Content: The loot boxes and perks definitely make the game feel better.
I've gone from playing only when a friend hit me up for some matches, which could be once or twice a week, to playing a few matches nearly every day.

The loot boxes are nice simply because fashion is the endgame of any live service game worth it's salt. If I'm gonna be dping the same shit hundreds or thousands of times I wanna do it in *style*, dammit. And the LBs giving me a bunch of cosmetics definitely helps.

But the perks? Hooo boy. The perks add some spice to an already fast & flashy combat experience. Just going into fights and never being exactly sure what the opponent is going to be capable of, and you being able to surprise them as well, is so damned fun. Had absolute curb stomp games turned on their heads when people's perks came online. Some more impactful than others, yes, but plenty of surprises to be had. Torb sticking turrets onto ceilings? Mauga setting people on fire with his stomp? Kiriko throwing out healing every time she lands a kunai? Genji having goddamned lifesteal on Dragon Blade?

Yeah. It's been fun. Some of these perks need to be changed but it's mostly been a good time.

Had a game where the enemy team’s dps swapped to symmetra and Mei to help counter my tank (sigma). Made sense to me cuz we were absolutely rolling them and if they didn’t find a way to mow down our tank we were gonna have a first point victory. They swapped and started rolling us. My tank swapped to Zar to counter their Dva and not be weak to beam users. (In my opinion - smart)

Well the other team got salty cuz the swap instantly stopped the one sided beat down again.

As a personal victory I told their supports to hush and then aced. I was reaper the whole game.

2025-02-22 18:17:37,942 - INFO - Content: Is it worth it to counter-switch now that you also lose perk progression?
Perks have been out for a good few days now, and I was wondering how this changes the whole "Counterwatch" gameplay.

I'm not sure if it was intentionally or not, but now once your character has progressed a couple levels, you're essentially hard locked into them. When switching heroes, you lose all perk progression. Now, especially if you've already unlocked a major perk, you're at risk for a major nerf when switching heroes after a few minutes into the game. Of course though, it also allows you to choose perks throughout the game that may not keep you hard-countered if you were previously having trouble.

This is certainly an interesting change that drastically effects the gameplay. How often do you swap heroes now? Under what conditions do you do so, if ever?

Kill the supports. Don't shoot a zarya when there 2 supports pocketing her.

Don't miss all shots on an echo with a non moving support on the ground.

Why do people still not know to kill them.

2025-02-23 07:35:04,958 - INFO - Content: Mics are useless in ow2
People always say that overwatch is a team game but in reality (especially in low ranks) it feels much more solo. I decided to get a mic awhile back and so far it's been almost useless, because everyone has their voice chat disabled and even if people has in enabled they don't communicate. So I've come to the conclusion that most people that are in "elo hell" is because of lack of communication in their lobbies (along with various other reasons people come up with).

I think I found the best way of doing zenyattas weapon, making something that could be dull into something way more fun.
And it’s do to each ball as an element with a unique kill effect depending on which ball does the final blow. The florist could be zen doing a roulette by spinning his balls to get a random one:

Depending on which is the last ball, the kill effect will be…

Fire- The enemy turns into a blaze

Water- the enemy turns into a pool of water 

Snow- the enemy turns into ice (like meis ult)

Rock- the enemy turns to stone and crumbles 

Lightning- the enemy is zapped 

Time- the enemy turns into dust 

Force- the enemy gets shot into the atmosphere

Darkness- the enemy turns black

I got the 9.99 starter pack (the 1000 coins and the skin) on my account. My husband got it on his as well but I have my paypal attached to his xbox (we share our funds anyways lol). But it cost $10.83. Not really a huge difference but I can’t think of any reason it would cost more? It says the same exact thing was purchased. Just wondering why that would happen and where that extra dollar went lol

Mine was my Reinhardt said I wasnt healing him. I was playing Brig. I was using 1 or 2 packs on him when needed and always procked my inspire (they had Dva so my inspire was up most of the game) I explained to him that Brig is not supposed to heal tank all the time her job is to keep squishies safe. I also had the second highest healing right after my friend who was playing Kiriko. Yet he started throwing. He said I needed to apologise and start healing him if I wanted him to stop throwing. Which I obviously didnt apologise. I know numbers aren't everything but even before throwing he had the most deaths and lowest elims and had the weirdest positioning. I know for a Rein elims are not gonna be high but I would expect Rein to have less deaths than average. This was a Diamond lobby btw. Even in Diamond some people dont seem to understand how Brig works. Did you guys ever had a player throwing for the dumbest reason?

I'm a mystery hero enjoyer, there I said it, I admit it. Since OW2 started, I've spent prob 30% of my game time in mystery heroes and I know there's a fairly large community for it. And I love the new perks system and have been grinding quite a bit this season in all modes. 

What is yalls opinion on the state of MH since perks?  For me, it's made me not want to play MH because perks reset upon death. It's like dangling the carrot in front of us, but we can hardly ever partake.  

I hope they add some special rules for mystery heroes that makes perks part of the average game. Until then I'm sticking with comp and qp.
