With Wuayng‚Äôs hero trial coming up in the next seasom, are there any hopes you all have for his possible kit?

Personally, I think it would be really cool if he‚Äôs another melee healer like Brig, mostly because I love the bo staff as a weapon and his outfit kinda gives me martial artist vibes.

Also, I really hope he has a cleanse somewhere in his base kit (no perk necessary) since it just makes sense for a water-based hero to have a cleanse imo. Plus, it would allow for another anti-heal counter in case Kiriko gets banned!
