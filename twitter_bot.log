2025-03-06 20:15:38,561 - INFO - Content: What is your unpopular opinions/hot takes?
Curious what other people's are tbh. 

My main one is that people hating/wanting nerfs for famously annoying characters (such as sym, torb, roadhog, junkrat etc) is reasonable. I can see characters that people find annoying taking all the fun out of the match for some people. (I personally don't have too many hated characters but they're mostly dive purely because I mainly play ana). 

Oh and that old dps passive was better. That reload and moment speed was so damn fun.

Edit: my other main one is that ow simply was never made for console. Having to pick between long range accuracy with a lowER sensitivity or being able to actually turn around while being jumped by a tracer, sombra, genji etc is insane.

I feel like the amount you get is insanely low, Iâ€™ve played over 60 games now and only have around 1500, Iâ€™ve also nearly finished the battle pass before Iâ€™ve even gotten a single gun skin.

Thereâ€™s like 42 characters, I want to be able to get be able more than 3 of the weapon skins.. I understand that getting a lot of points from the  drives is a thing but I donâ€™t like waiting that long to be able to get them.

I just donâ€™t feel rewarded for actually playing comp when Iâ€™m mostly just playing it for the pretty guns.

Serious question. It takes months to years for things to be planned, developed, tested and implemented so how would it even be possible for them to create all this content in a matter of a few months. On top of that, are we going to pretend the last 2-3 years hasn't been constant upgrades, reworks, patches, balanced, new heroes, new maps, QoL changes, etc.?? Don't get me wrong I do believe there are some things OW2 brought in as a response to MR but it's no where near as much as a bunch of you claim. Lying to yourself to justify your hateboner is weird
