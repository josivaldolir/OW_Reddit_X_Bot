2025-02-22 15:13:21,017 - INFO - Content: The loot boxes and perks definitely make the game feel better.
I've gone from playing only when a friend hit me up for some matches, which could be once or twice a week, to playing a few matches nearly every day.

The loot boxes are nice simply because fashion is the endgame of any live service game worth it's salt. If I'm gonna be dping the same shit hundreds or thousands of times I wanna do it in *style*, dammit. And the LBs giving me a bunch of cosmetics definitely helps.

But the perks? Hooo boy. The perks add some spice to an already fast & flashy combat experience. Just going into fights and never being exactly sure what the opponent is going to be capable of, and you being able to surprise them as well, is so damned fun. Had absolute curb stomp games turned on their heads when people's perks came online. Some more impactful than others, yes, but plenty of surprises to be had. Torb sticking turrets onto ceilings? Mauga setting people on fire with his stomp? Kiriko throwing out healing every time she lands a kunai? Genji having goddamned lifesteal on Dragon Blade?

Yeah. It's been fun. Some of these perks need to be changed but it's mostly been a good time.

Had a game where the enemy team’s dps swapped to symmetra and Mei to help counter my tank (sigma). Made sense to me cuz we were absolutely rolling them and if they didn’t find a way to mow down our tank we were gonna have a first point victory. They swapped and started rolling us. My tank swapped to Zar to counter their Dva and not be weak to beam users. (In my opinion - smart)

Well the other team got salty cuz the swap instantly stopped the one sided beat down again.

As a personal victory I told their supports to hush and then aced. I was reaper the whole game.

2025-02-22 18:17:37,942 - INFO - Content: Is it worth it to counter-switch now that you also lose perk progression?
Perks have been out for a good few days now, and I was wondering how this changes the whole "Counterwatch" gameplay.

I'm not sure if it was intentionally or not, but now once your character has progressed a couple levels, you're essentially hard locked into them. When switching heroes, you lose all perk progression. Now, especially if you've already unlocked a major perk, you're at risk for a major nerf when switching heroes after a few minutes into the game. Of course though, it also allows you to choose perks throughout the game that may not keep you hard-countered if you were previously having trouble.

This is certainly an interesting change that drastically effects the gameplay. How often do you swap heroes now? Under what conditions do you do so, if ever?

Kill the supports. Don't shoot a zarya when there 2 supports pocketing her.

Don't miss all shots on an echo with a non moving support on the ground.

Why do people still not know to kill them.

2025-02-23 07:35:04,958 - INFO - Content: Mics are useless in ow2
People always say that overwatch is a team game but in reality (especially in low ranks) it feels much more solo. I decided to get a mic awhile back and so far it's been almost useless, because everyone has their voice chat disabled and even if people has in enabled they don't communicate. So I've come to the conclusion that most people that are in "elo hell" is because of lack of communication in their lobbies (along with various other reasons people come up with).

I think I found the best way of doing zenyattas weapon, making something that could be dull into something way more fun.
And it’s do to each ball as an element with a unique kill effect depending on which ball does the final blow. The florist could be zen doing a roulette by spinning his balls to get a random one:

Depending on which is the last ball, the kill effect will be…

Fire- The enemy turns into a blaze

Water- the enemy turns into a pool of water 

Snow- the enemy turns into ice (like meis ult)

Rock- the enemy turns to stone and crumbles 

Lightning- the enemy is zapped 

Time- the enemy turns into dust 

Force- the enemy gets shot into the atmosphere

Darkness- the enemy turns black

I got the 9.99 starter pack (the 1000 coins and the skin) on my account. My husband got it on his as well but I have my paypal attached to his xbox (we share our funds anyways lol). But it cost $10.83. Not really a huge difference but I can’t think of any reason it would cost more? It says the same exact thing was purchased. Just wondering why that would happen and where that extra dollar went lol

Mine was my Reinhardt said I wasnt healing him. I was playing Brig. I was using 1 or 2 packs on him when needed and always procked my inspire (they had Dva so my inspire was up most of the game) I explained to him that Brig is not supposed to heal tank all the time her job is to keep squishies safe. I also had the second highest healing right after my friend who was playing Kiriko. Yet he started throwing. He said I needed to apologise and start healing him if I wanted him to stop throwing. Which I obviously didnt apologise. I know numbers aren't everything but even before throwing he had the most deaths and lowest elims and had the weirdest positioning. I know for a Rein elims are not gonna be high but I would expect Rein to have less deaths than average. This was a Diamond lobby btw. Even in Diamond some people dont seem to understand how Brig works. Did you guys ever had a player throwing for the dumbest reason?

I'm a mystery hero enjoyer, there I said it, I admit it. Since OW2 started, I've spent prob 30% of my game time in mystery heroes and I know there's a fairly large community for it. And I love the new perks system and have been grinding quite a bit this season in all modes. 

What is yalls opinion on the state of MH since perks?  For me, it's made me not want to play MH because perks reset upon death. It's like dangling the carrot in front of us, but we can hardly ever partake.  

I hope they add some special rules for mystery heroes that makes perks part of the average game. Until then I'm sticking with comp and qp.

Check it out now: [https://perks.owldle.com/](https://perks.owldle.com/)   
  
Guess the right perk given its icon and four possible answers. The game also features different difficulty modes (which can be found in the settings menu on the top right) like a hard mode, where you have to guess the exact perk name.   
  
If you have any feedback, please let me know! I plan to add more updates and difficulty settings and a potential score system overhaul soon.

She is in, and I **do not** exaggerate -- nearly absolutely every single match I play.  
She completely dominates in every single match she's in. The only exception is if the enemy has a better Soj.  
And because she's so absurd, pocketing her is basically mandatory, meaning now Mercy is almost a must-pick.  

&nbsp;  


She's so gamebreakingly overtuned it's not funny. This shit is not fun. It's just fucking exhausting.

In case you don't know what the hell Marvel ruins is, it's a universe where everything went wrong, very, VERY wrong. 

For example:

The punisher died on his first night as a vigilante

Magneto cant control is powers and died when tons of meta were flying at him

When the spider bit Peter, instead of giving him powers, it gave him an incurable disease that killed him slowly and agonizingly. 

Instead of becoming Hulk, Bruce became a mass of tumors who died in pain and suffering.

You get the point

Something not so crazy that I can see happening is that Talon didn't manage to completely brainwash Widow, and when she killed her husband, the pain and agony of what she had done made her end her own life right then and there, who knows, maybe after dressing her dead husband with the clothes he wore for their weeding, whie she uses her weeding dress, what do you think?

(Please don't take it to serious, it was the result of a fun gaming night)

I was playing Overwatch with a friend (non-player) and they asked me why Orisa is not wearing anything. After the first confusion and their explanation it kinda clicked.

Zenyatta is an Omnic, wears clothes
Ramattra is an Omnic, wears clothes
B.O.B wears clothes and a fancy hat
While Bastion too isn't wearing anything, they aren't sentinent in a "human" way (And in OW2 have the cap) 

Most the Omnics in the maps or official media also wear clothes. 

So why not Orisa?

*Tracer* and *Genji* are still [the only two heroes with increased base movement speed](https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki/Movement_speed) **(+8.7% faster)**. 

Why are they not using this for some other heroes? They never touch movement speed when it comes to balancing. They could use this to buff / nerf heroes in other ways than just changing damage and CD numbers.

^(Personally, I wouldn't mind if venture got the increased movement speed... but who am I to judge balancing.)

2025-02-25 11:12:28,629 - INFO - Content: payload maps are the backbone of Overwatch.
I only get hyped for comp when I see a payload map, perhaps it’s the nostalgia of the og payload maps but I also love the new payload maps? Hate playing push maps. There is no order, it’s just all chaos, everyone feeds, there’s too many angles. Just never feels as fun as a payload map where you’re on the cart holding it for you life, especially in overtime. The spawn points aren’t as far (ahem… ignoring numbani second point). with push it just feels like I spend half the game walking back to the fight. Just not an enjoyable game mode. Flashpoint is chill and I dearly miss 2cp 🫶🏼

2025-02-25 13:42:26,780 - INFO - Content: To Metal Rank players that have Tracer on their team
**Tracer is not a backline assassin** unless she is smurfing or mechanically superior to everyone else in the lobby. The 4k backline wipe Tracer is more often than not a fantasy and not what you should expect in your games (especially not metal ranks...!)

Her job is to take angles that deny the enemy team positions. Essentially, she herds everyone together and if they disrespect her, they die. Once the enemies are grouped up, they're typically in less ideal positions that your team can more easily capitalize on, and she'll play off that from the angle. That's when you see her get a ton of kills.

She is not like Widow, Sojourn, Junkrat, etc., who get immediate and obvious value. There's set up, patience, and ability tracking on her end. 

**ALSO**

By nature of taking up close 1v1s, Tracer doesn't have the luxury of spamming damage across the map. So yes, she can still be contributing with 5k damage if your Soldier has 10k. 

**Tl;dr:** I've been flamed consistently if we lose the first fight as I relearn this character on mouse and keyboard.

i like witch mercy, i think the skin still holds up years later and i like the recolour too. you can also see it's influence in the widowmaker mythic, which i think is another point to how iconic it is.

You know, because you start with zero perks, then you get one, then two. The current numbers make no sense to me... this is incredibly inconsequenrial and petty but it just makes more logical sense to me, am I the only one?

I posted yesterday morning asking when the galactic variants would be purchasable, turns out I just had to wait a few hours. But once I said I got it I got a couple comments asking to see, so here it is!

The colors match perfectly with Optimus, but I think it also works great with Rein's mythic skin if you use the blue color theme.

There isn’t even an option for “default” that other weapon skins have. I CANT GET THIS THIMG OFF. I’m sorry if someone else has posted about this but this is a crazy oversight from blizzard 😭

2025-02-26 23:36:54,854 - INFO - Content: Im a Collegiate and OWCS Competitor and randomly banned
tl;dr - Blizzard has banned my account (a OWCS player and 4 year collegiate participant in OW) and automatically denied appeal.  Big streamer banned for “cheating” at the exact same time and instantly unbanned without submitting appeal.  No response from blizzard.  Friends also getting banned for having queued with me.

I’ve dedicated years to Overwatch and have competed at the highest levels—playing in collegiate tournaments as well as playing in OWCS.  I’ve been top 500 multiple seasons and  streamed my matches before (to little viewers or engagement).
  
Recently, upon returning to play the game for season 15, I got randomly banned in my 10th or so game.  I was obviously quite shocked and angry as what purpose would cheating serve me when I can beat most cheaters anyway.  I put in a ticket and later that night at 2am I got an automated response saying: This action has been taken in accordance with our Terms of Use and our In-game Policies ( https://blizzard.com/support/article/42673 ), which all players acknowledge and agree to prior to playing.
  
Now obviously no person is working at blizzard reviewing my ticket at 2am (I’m aware time zones are a thing but my time zone is about an hour off of Blizzards time).  So I looked into other peoples experiences and almost everyone has said the same thing: No one is looking at these tickets initially.  It is a bot automatically denying these tickets.
  
Looking around to see if anyone else was randomly banned at this time, I found that Harbleu was also banned at the EXACT SAME TIME.  https://x.com/harbleuow/status/1892375484815610354?s=46&t=6nILWKX4-XCWR7bLX2C72g. 
  
Great, someone else big is having the same issue, that means that they will look into the issue and it will get fixed right?  Well… I think anyone can see where this is going.  Harbleu immediately gets his account unbanned without even making a ticket and there is no word about fixing this for the little guys that don’t just have a blizzard contact.
  
Anyway it’s been a week and I still have 0 contact from a human at blizzard regarding this action taken against my account.  And from what I have heard, there is a great chance there will not be a human at blizzard that will review my account.
  
Do you guys wanna know what the real kicker is?  The people that I have been queuing with at night to learn the perk system and prepare for OWCS have ALSO been banned for queueing with me.  Seriously blizzard?
  
So anyway, be careful playing the game right now as I know I am not the only one affected by this and I know multiple others falsely banned for cheating with similar lack of contact with blizzard.
  
It doesn’t even need to be you that was banned, it could be your unlucky friend that you play quick-play with every now and then.

2025-02-27 07:14:02,763 - INFO - Content: Is Ashe's perk "Viper's Sting" bugged, or am I bad at math/stupid?
https://reddit.com/link/1iyzvg0/video/b3u4kuix3kle1/player

So, the wiki says Ashe does 75 damage with her weapon when ADS'ing, and she has a 2X headshot multiplier (I tested in the practice range and it's true). That means 75+2\*75=225 damage from a bodyshot and a headshot. Her perk gives 25 extra damage if you hit two shots consecutively, which should make it 75+2\*75+25=250. However, heroes seem to only take 249 damage from this combo (or something similar) which doesn't make any sense to me. Am I stupid or is there a bug?

2025-02-27 08:41:51,419 - INFO - Content: Better rein perks 101 and why
Rein's perks are awful. They emphasize his shield usage in a very dynamic game like overwatch 2 instead of promoting his other abilities. Shield used to be rein's signature ability in ow1 but it shouldn't be the case anymore. Everyone has either a lot of mobility or great sustainability that counter rein static gameplay. Nowadays you dont see a lot of rein players in high elo because they are too many counters. Hence, I believe that instead of focusing on his shield, the dev team should focus more on his charge and utlimate. 

Minor perks: 

1. Fire in the Hole: Fire strike sets on fire the targets hit (25 damage over 5 seconds) 
2. Autobahn: Charge distance increased by 30% and speed increased by 20 %

* Major perks:

1. Sky Shatter: Ultimate turns into a leap that is followed by a shatter when reaching the ground
2. Unstoppable Force: Removes movement penalty while holding shield up.

Sorry for the corny names but it fits the character

2025-02-27 09:37:56,957 - INFO - Content: I played against a sick ball today... wow.
Now I understand him. His biggest strength is the sheer amazing ground cover and always staying full hp. The enemy ball kept going in DEEP all the way to spawn to surgically kill loners or even 2v1.

I watched the replay of this mofo. He literally ran into Mercy and Cassidy. The ball deleted Mercy while tanking Cassidy shots, then reloaded to finish him with a boop, shooting, and melee. I think Cassidy landed every shot and Ball just had too much hp to care.

We were completely staggered and disjointed.

I've never seen such a smart ball player that always seemed to disappear after eating all CDs or constantly AOE-ratfuck the whole enemy team. He's either an assassin or team AOE mince-meat maker.

He can basically kill any non-tank heroes 1v1 (Completely toys/baits with Bastion to waste his form and even stings Reaper from medium distance... the rest are literally food). And his ability to be anywhere deep into enemy positions makes this very oppressive.

We had 3 hard counters - sombra, junk trap (hard stop), and hog. The ball player didn't switch, just outplayed all of us.

I saw him spy-check Sombra, grapple in, and kill. Twice. Counter my ass. Sombra tried to teleport away, but ball has a 4 CD infinite floor slider.

I play solo queue so it’s impossible to coordinate my team to play around her. I’m genuinely so bored of zarya, she needs a change to her abilities asap.

I stopped playing OW a year ago and returned for season 15. I am really enjoying this season with the new perk system! Love the loot boxes! I am a support main but recently started playing tank due to the perks and I am loving it. I don’t play comp anymore due to raging but the new gun skins look great!  I have a feeling season 16 will be even better. I tried marvels and yes, it’s a fun game but I don’t think it’s for me due to how unpolished it looks and I honestly feel like the rival community are worst than the OW community.

This ball who literally just did not do anything in game purposefully, no damage, no kills, no deaths. Was just trolling. I got all the players from my team and enemy team to report him and he got banned :)

Edit:

Yall I mean ACROSS the map, like I’m on payload with the team and one team mate is off trying to spawn camp or some sh*t (so super far from the main fight), and then they get on complaining about heals. I love a good chaotic game where I’m zipping around between my tank and dps the whole time (I main lifeweaver), I try to get line of sight for any teammate that is clearly too low to get to me. I also try and tail my tank (or with LW just keep them in range), a good charging tank (like ball and DF) tend to put themselves in good places to get quick heals, as long as you pay attention.

Personally I think it's absolute BS that the two options when you meet a group of people who dance on the cart are
a) lock yourself into boring "chill no kill" lobby
b) get penalised for leaving a game people are refusing to play.. not the others who are actively throwing?

I honestly don't care if you go 1-12 with 1k damage. Everyone learns at different rates. 

What I can't stand though is being held captive in a game just spamming "Hello" and emoting. This is what custom games are for. 

I really shouldn't have to play comp just to find 9 people willing to shoot the enemy...

Apparently wanting your team to play objective is toxic and I need to go play comp. My team wanted to play ffa and just run around map, I suggested they play deathmatch if thats all they want to do, they said I'm whining and to play comp. My fault I don't want to play comp every time I play. Am I in the wrong?

2025-02-28 14:39:34,407 - INFO - Content: If You’re Going To Be Toxic, Don’t Cry When You Get Payback
I was playing some high diamond comp games early on the morning as Mercy because she’s my main. I know she’s not great, but all heroes are viable and why play a video game if I’m not having fun. 

My first game starts with my team getting full held on Hollywood attack. The second defense starts, my tank hops into voice to start complaining. Specifically he was unhappy that our Moira Mercy back line isn’t meta enough and it’s none of his 3-stacks fault the game went poorly. He was even less happy when I said I was playing Mercy because I think she’s my best hero and favorite to play. We lose the game, and while I’m annoyed, it’s just a game.

Except then I have him and the rest of his 3 stack again my next game, but on the enemy team. I lock in Kiriko, my team sweeps him and I get play of the game. I type in chat saying that maybe he was the reason we lost and he is not happy. I was told that I threw our first game by not picking Kiriko. I then go against him a second time, beat his team, and he’s even more unhappy.

I just wanted to share this funny experience I had because getting to beat a toxic player makes me enjoy this game even more. If you’re going to play comp, especially with a group, don’t go blaming your teammates for everything that goes wrong. There are so many mistakes everyone makes in a single game, and unless someone is genuinely throwing, it is no one persons fault a game is lost. My note to self is don’t play comp at 2 am again unless I want to see the same people playing in every match.

The last year’s worth of seasons has been very inspired in terms of season themes, and I’ve been a big fan of all of them! Personally, I’d love nothing more for them to revisit the Mirrorwatch concept- an Overwatch Mauga or Moira, or a Talon Mei, would be really cool in my opinion. What would you like to see them cover in future seasons?

2025-02-28 16:43:35,593 - INFO - Content: Who do yall think is getting the next Le sserafim collab skins?
My prediction:

• Ramattra - since it’s confirmed he’s getting a dance emote very soon

• Juno - Atp i think everyone agrees she’s getting one for sure

• Mercy - giving her a free skin seems very suspicious, maybe bc the collab skin will fund them for the next 5 years?

• Ashe - they already have a security guy bob designed so maybe

• Venture - don’t really have a reason for this one i just feel it 

• Lucio - he’s a music guy come on, also could be the free skin

Do you only say GG when it actually was a good game or do you just say it just because? I'm only asking this because I read it was supposedly video game "etiquette" like a football match

taisho-era clothing is simple and aesthetically pleasing.

junker queen takes up less space in her concept art than most tanks do, similar to ramattra.

I don’t know about plat and below but in diamond to low masters, every single match has a sojourn and it essentially comes down to who has the better sojourn. 

People complain about Widow but in reality she’s hardly ever present. Why pick Widow when you can pick Sojourn who is a much more mobile, tanky and pocketable hero who just deletes people almost as quickly as widow does minus any of the squishyness. 

What are we thinking here, what’s the consensus? Is she overtuned? Fine? I’m curious what the communities opinions on her currently are.
