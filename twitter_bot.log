Based on a match where only 1 teammate had Som as their 2nd vote or something and our Mercy didnâ€™t vote at all. So I (was on tank) told them at the start that they can deal with Som then, if there is 1. And then they proceeded to get FARMED by 1 all game

2025-06-02 03:08:14,198 - INFO - Content: How would you buff/change brig?
First off, I have yet to play stadium so this is standard mode talk(5v5). But I wanna say Brig is probably the most fun support to play for me. I have always loved defensive heavy builds but she needs a buff imo. Itâ€™s hard to enjoy her on a comp level as other supports are just much more dominate. Sheâ€™s in this weird no manâ€™s land where she is not really as useful as others in there categories. What I mean by this is she gets out healed by numerous other supports, she has a huge handicap for putting out damage/securing kills (have to be melee range/she also just doesnâ€™t hit hard in general), and finally her shield is super squishy while itâ€™s handy in certain situations you get melted very fast unless your whole team dives(and no Iâ€™m not on the frontline with her). I would like to see her have a buff defensively. What she could be good at is healing and just being able to survive but takes a hit offensively where her whip shot specifically doesnâ€™t do the same damage but maybe you can throw it out twice as often just for the sheer fact thatâ€™s your main way to proc inspire. Iâ€™d like to see maybe a hp buff or a shield hp buff at the very least. Possibly no on this and having her shield regen hp faster while also being in use would be acceptable instead of an hp buff(shield currently only regens when not in use). I would just like to see her used merely as a defensive fortification where you heal allies and mitigate damage with your shield but not being offensively dominant. All I know is currently sheâ€™s fun to play but lacks compared to others and needs changing imo. I get she was insanely overpowered back in the day. What changes would you give her that make her better while also maintaining balance?

I love the disability representation OW has.

I find Junker Queen, Roadhog and Juno debatable; not sure if the environments they come from render their bodies weaker or stronger.

2025-06-02 17:14:26,832 - INFO - Content: I asked all of the Overwatch Main Subs to rank their character's difficulty on a 1 to 5 scale. Here are the results.
Overall for the most part, I am pleasantly surprised with how this turned out. And it was really fun to read all of the responses from dedicated players. That being said, here are some quick things I just want to point out.

I did not specify rank - Anytime someone mentioned their rank, at the lowest end I saw platinum players voice themselves. The highest was from a few champions. I wanted to attempt to get a mixed bag of results.

I didn't include Cassidy and Sojourn on the graph because I honestly forgot to put them on. But I have their players rankings nonetheless. 

**Cassidy - 2.75**

**Sojourn - 2.25**

I'm sorry to anyone who got bombarded by my posts yesterday. I did not think people would end up seeing  ten+ different posts. And no, I was not karma farming. 

Personal Thoughts - What I did NOT expect was how Moira's mains ranked her. I expected a lot of them to say two or three, and explain proceed to explain that fade jumps are difficult or something. But all of them were straight up like "yeah she's easy lol." The two I did not expect to be so high up were Sombra and Hanzo. And I expected Freja to be higher, since the dev team literally stated she would be one of the hardest characters play on the roster. So that mindset was initially in many players heads. So I definitely did not expect to see her that low on the overall board. 

[My favorite response](https://www.reddit.com/r/JunkRatMains/comments/1l0zzdl/how_would_you_rank_junkrats_difficulty_on_a_1_to/) was in JunkratMains, and the top comment has convinced me that Junkrat is one of the best designed characters in the game now lol.

2025-06-02 19:12:08,314 - INFO - Content: I asked all of the Overwatch Main Subs to rank their character's difficulty on a 1 to 5 scale. Here are the results.
Overall for the most part, I am pleasantly surprised with how this turned out. And it was really fun to read all of the responses from dedicated players. That being said, here are some quick things I just want to point out.

I did not specify rank - Anytime someone mentioned their rank, at the lowest end I saw platinum players voice themselves. The highest was from a few champions. I wanted to attempt to get a mixed bag of results.

I didn't include Cassidy and Sojourn on the graph because I honestly forgot to put them on. But I have their players rankings nonetheless. 

**Cassidy - 2.75**

**Sojourn - 2.25**

I'm sorry to anyone who got bombarded by my posts yesterday. I did not think people would end up seeing  ten+ different posts. And no, I was not karma farming. 

Personal Thoughts - What I did NOT expect was how Moira's mains ranked her. I expected a lot of them to say two or three, and explain proceed to explain that fade jumps are difficult or something. But all of them were straight up like "yeah she's easy lol." The two I did not expect to be so high up were Sombra and Hanzo. And I expected Freja to be higher, since the dev team literally stated she would be one of the hardest characters play on the roster. So that mindset was initially in many players heads. So I definitely did not expect to see her that low on the overall board. 

[My favorite response](https://www.reddit.com/r/JunkRatMains/comments/1l0zzdl/how_would_you_rank_junkrats_difficulty_on_a_1_to/) was in JunkratMains, and the top comment has convinced me that Junkrat is one of the best designed characters in the game now lol.

2025-06-02 20:46:50,700 - INFO - Content: The grammar of this pisses me off almost as much as the fact that someone left.
There should be a comma after "leaving" so that it reads:

>Due to a player leaving, this competitive match...

The way it's currently worded, it looks like "this competitive match" is connected to "due to a player leaving," not "will shutdown in 10 seconds." That is, it looks like it's saying this:

>Due to a player leaving this competitive match ***it*** will shutdown in 10 seconds."

But there's no "it," so the flow is weird. And honestly, that one could even do with a comma after "match."

Not to mention that "shutdown" is a noun (like, "we beat them so hard that it was a shutdown!"), but it's operating as a verb in that sentence. It should be two words: "shut down."

Please fix this, Blizzard, for it hurts my English major soul.

2025-06-03 08:22:57,791 - INFO - Content: Kiriko and Hanzo now have an unique ultimate voiceline for their mythics.
Well I'm saying now, but maybe it was implemented in an earlier patch and no one really noticed.

Kiriko says "Let my sunlight guide you"

And Hanzo says....well he says something different, most likely "Let vengeance consume you" in japanese.

So Ashe is the only hero left that still uses the regular ultimate voice line for her mythic. (While your allies do hear something unique, being "Destroy them, BOB !", the one playing Ashe still hears the regular ultimate voice line)

2025-06-03 12:32:22,346 - INFO - Content: Overwatch is fun for me again
I went through phases of being really into ow1, but after ow2 came out the game just wasnâ€™t fun for me anymore and I didnâ€™t play it much at all

I returned recently to try it out and the changes that theyâ€™ve made have gotten me addicted again so itâ€™s good to see this game is going in the right direction

1. Free hero unlocks are very important and Iâ€™m glad they realized this. I donâ€™t want to spend tons of time doing stupid challenges to unlock heroes

2. Regenerating health: this is something that Iâ€™ve always wished overwatch had and found it frustrating to not be in the game so another major improvement for me

3. Hero bans in ranked: good addition that is very standard in ranked modes for most games

4. Dps anti heal: another downside  of ow was that the ttk could feel way too long because healing is strong so having some anti heal is definitely a good thing, otherwise you just feel like your damage is absolutely pointless 

5. Perks: at first i didnâ€™t think I would like perks but now I think theyâ€™re pretty good, offers some more variety and playstyle choice

6. Stadium: seems like a solid concept and definitely good that they added something to give us a new experience, only played 1 game of this so far Iâ€™ve just been playing ranked

I would like to say good job to the developers for making this game fun again with some smart changes and decisions
