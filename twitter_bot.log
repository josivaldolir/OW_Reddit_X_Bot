Based on a match where only 1 teammate had Som as their 2nd vote or something and our Mercy didn’t vote at all. So I (was on tank) told them at the start that they can deal with Som then, if there is 1. And then they proceeded to get FARMED by 1 all game

2025-06-02 03:08:14,198 - INFO - Content: How would you buff/change brig?
First off, I have yet to play stadium so this is standard mode talk(5v5). But I wanna say Brig is probably the most fun support to play for me. I have always loved defensive heavy builds but she needs a buff imo. It’s hard to enjoy her on a comp level as other supports are just much more dominate. She’s in this weird no man’s land where she is not really as useful as others in there categories. What I mean by this is she gets out healed by numerous other supports, she has a huge handicap for putting out damage/securing kills (have to be melee range/she also just doesn’t hit hard in general), and finally her shield is super squishy while it’s handy in certain situations you get melted very fast unless your whole team dives(and no I’m not on the frontline with her). I would like to see her have a buff defensively. What she could be good at is healing and just being able to survive but takes a hit offensively where her whip shot specifically doesn’t do the same damage but maybe you can throw it out twice as often just for the sheer fact that’s your main way to proc inspire. I’d like to see maybe a hp buff or a shield hp buff at the very least. Possibly no on this and having her shield regen hp faster while also being in use would be acceptable instead of an hp buff(shield currently only regens when not in use). I would just like to see her used merely as a defensive fortification where you heal allies and mitigate damage with your shield but not being offensively dominant. All I know is currently she’s fun to play but lacks compared to others and needs changing imo. I get she was insanely overpowered back in the day. What changes would you give her that make her better while also maintaining balance?

Needless to say, we were overrun and **LITERALLY** spawn locked. I was trying to pick their healers from the safety of the spawn room, but apparently dealing damage from inside it doesn’t count as being an active player…

2025-06-02 17:14:26,832 - INFO - Content: I asked all of the Overwatch Main Subs to rank their character's difficulty on a 1 to 5 scale. Here are the results.
Overall for the most part, I am pleasantly surprised with how this turned out. And it was really fun to read all of the responses from dedicated players. That being said, here are some quick things I just want to point out.

I did not specify rank - Anytime someone mentioned their rank, at the lowest end I saw platinum players voice themselves. The highest was from a few champions. I wanted to attempt to get a mixed bag of results.

I didn't include Cassidy and Sojourn on the graph because I honestly forgot to put them on. But I have their players rankings nonetheless. 

**Cassidy - 2.75**

**Sojourn - 2.25**

I'm sorry to anyone who got bombarded by my posts yesterday. I did not think people would end up seeing  ten+ different posts. And no, I was not karma farming. 

Personal Thoughts - What I did NOT expect was how Moira's mains ranked her. I expected a lot of them to say two or three, and explain proceed to explain that fade jumps are difficult or something. But all of them were straight up like "yeah she's easy lol." The two I did not expect to be so high up were Sombra and Hanzo. And I expected Freja to be higher, since the dev team literally stated she would be one of the hardest characters play on the roster. So that mindset was initially in many players heads. So I definitely did not expect to see her that low on the overall board. 

[My favorite response](https://www.reddit.com/r/JunkRatMains/comments/1l0zzdl/how_would_you_rank_junkrats_difficulty_on_a_1_to/) was in JunkratMains, and the top comment has convinced me that Junkrat is one of the best designed characters in the game now lol.

2025-06-02 19:12:08,314 - INFO - Content: I asked all of the Overwatch Main Subs to rank their character's difficulty on a 1 to 5 scale. Here are the results.
Overall for the most part, I am pleasantly surprised with how this turned out. And it was really fun to read all of the responses from dedicated players. That being said, here are some quick things I just want to point out.

I did not specify rank - Anytime someone mentioned their rank, at the lowest end I saw platinum players voice themselves. The highest was from a few champions. I wanted to attempt to get a mixed bag of results.

I didn't include Cassidy and Sojourn on the graph because I honestly forgot to put them on. But I have their players rankings nonetheless. 

**Cassidy - 2.75**

**Sojourn - 2.25**

I'm sorry to anyone who got bombarded by my posts yesterday. I did not think people would end up seeing  ten+ different posts. And no, I was not karma farming. 

Personal Thoughts - What I did NOT expect was how Moira's mains ranked her. I expected a lot of them to say two or three, and explain proceed to explain that fade jumps are difficult or something. But all of them were straight up like "yeah she's easy lol." The two I did not expect to be so high up were Sombra and Hanzo. And I expected Freja to be higher, since the dev team literally stated she would be one of the hardest characters play on the roster. So that mindset was initially in many players heads. So I definitely did not expect to see her that low on the overall board. 

[My favorite response](https://www.reddit.com/r/JunkRatMains/comments/1l0zzdl/how_would_you_rank_junkrats_difficulty_on_a_1_to/) was in JunkratMains, and the top comment has convinced me that Junkrat is one of the best designed characters in the game now lol.

2025-06-02 20:46:50,700 - INFO - Content: The grammar of this pisses me off almost as much as the fact that someone left.
There should be a comma after "leaving" so that it reads:

>Due to a player leaving, this competitive match...

The way it's currently worded, it looks like "this competitive match" is connected to "due to a player leaving," not "will shutdown in 10 seconds." That is, it looks like it's saying this:

>Due to a player leaving this competitive match ***it*** will shutdown in 10 seconds."

But there's no "it," so the flow is weird. And honestly, that one could even do with a comma after "match."

Not to mention that "shutdown" is a noun (like, "we beat them so hard that it was a shutdown!"), but it's operating as a verb in that sentence. It should be two words: "shut down."

Please fix this, Blizzard, for it hurts my English major soul.

2025-06-03 08:22:57,791 - INFO - Content: Kiriko and Hanzo now have an unique ultimate voiceline for their mythics.
Well I'm saying now, but maybe it was implemented in an earlier patch and no one really noticed.

Kiriko says "Let my sunlight guide you"

And Hanzo says....well he says something different, most likely "Let vengeance consume you" in japanese.

So Ashe is the only hero left that still uses the regular ultimate voice line for her mythic. (While your allies do hear something unique, being "Destroy them, BOB !", the one playing Ashe still hears the regular ultimate voice line)

2025-06-03 12:32:22,346 - INFO - Content: Overwatch is fun for me again
I went through phases of being really into ow1, but after ow2 came out the game just wasn’t fun for me anymore and I didn’t play it much at all

I returned recently to try it out and the changes that they’ve made have gotten me addicted again so it’s good to see this game is going in the right direction

1. Free hero unlocks are very important and I’m glad they realized this. I don’t want to spend tons of time doing stupid challenges to unlock heroes

2. Regenerating health: this is something that I’ve always wished overwatch had and found it frustrating to not be in the game so another major improvement for me

3. Hero bans in ranked: good addition that is very standard in ranked modes for most games

4. Dps anti heal: another downside  of ow was that the ttk could feel way too long because healing is strong so having some anti heal is definitely a good thing, otherwise you just feel like your damage is absolutely pointless 

5. Perks: at first i didn’t think I would like perks but now I think they’re pretty good, offers some more variety and playstyle choice

6. Stadium: seems like a solid concept and definitely good that they added something to give us a new experience, only played 1 game of this so far I’ve just been playing ranked

I would like to say good job to the developers for making this game fun again with some smart changes and decisions

So, out of all the bad shit that has happened with Blizzard and how bad they can be, it is genuinely awesome that Overwatch is a very loudly pro queer game. That the face of OW1 was a lesbian, or that Soldier, the most 'Call of Duty' character in this game is gay and the CoD players will just have to accept it, is a nice thing about this game, to giving us plenty of pride makers/icons/player backgrounds (i forget what they are called, the long rectangle image that goes next to your name in a comp match)

I really want to give props to this, because the only other multiplayer game that I play frequently is Helldivers 2, and unfortunatly Arrowhead - the developers of that game - have shown themselves to be a huge pussy because they won't put a pride flag on because they're scared their homophobic players will stop playing the game.

It's going to get more and more common for big IPs to tone down on the gay representation in the coming years because the three most powerful governments in the world all fucking hate queers, so I hope OW stays the course.

Happy Pride!

At first I was like “okay, maybe they’re friends with the same usernames, not out of the ordinary.”

NOPE. Turns out this guy is running TWO XBOXS TO PLAY FUCKING OVERWATCH.

Now you may say, “oh, you don’t know that they’re the same person.” 

It was so deadly clear they were the same. 

He would play Ashe first, hide Cassidy in a corner, and then whenever Ashe died, he’d pick up on Cassidy. 

The worst part is, it was stadium.

 No, that wasn’t THE WORST PART. the whole time our tank and other support were complaining that Cassidy sucked. HMMM I WONDER WHY?

Then our rein started to be toxic saying “gg no team” after we lost THE VERY FIRST ROUND. HMM I WONDER TF WHY

we did eventually turn it around, ended the game off at 3-4. We could’ve won if that one person didn’t decide to play two different characters.

I reported them on Overwatch and Xbox. 
Doubtful anything will happen on Xbox, but I’m praying something happens on OW.

While watching a replay I was flabbergasted by how far her biotic grasp can reach. Am I just too noob or is this really kinda messed up? I read online that it can reach up to 20m, which is crazy to me

This tier list is me ranking how interested I’d be watching a cinematic based off on the character. My rationale for the ranking is if this character has a lot of lore that needs to be explored, or just needs some time in the light, the higher the ranking. The lower the ranking, either I believe their lore has been explored enough via mini comics and short stories, narratively not worth expanding upon in a cinematic, or I think their character is just flat-out disinteresting. 

I know some characters introduced in Overwatch 2 (Not the new launch heroes) have already technically been represented in an animated short, but let’s just put on our thinking caps for a second an have some fun!

2025-06-04 20:14:08,811 - INFO - Content: Why are some people so obsessed with whether or not a hero takes skill?
I see it quite a bit in game, people go off on each other about playing characters that take "no skill" or "less skill" than the character they are playing. They died to a Junkrat as Sojourn? Well, he's no skill, so....

It seems like they only think characters you have to aim with require skill. Ashe, Cassidy, Widowmaker, Sojourn, Tracer, Ana, Bap, etc.

I think these people forgot that this is a video game and we are supposed to be having fun. It's okay to dislike a character, but when it extends to harassing their players, that's a bit TOO far.
