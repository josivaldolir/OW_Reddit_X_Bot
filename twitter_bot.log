Based on a match where only 1 teammate had Som as their 2nd vote or something and our Mercy didn’t vote at all. So I (was on tank) told them at the start that they can deal with Som then, if there is 1. And then they proceeded to get FARMED by 1 all game

2025-06-02 03:08:14,198 - INFO - Content: How would you buff/change brig?
First off, I have yet to play stadium so this is standard mode talk(5v5). But I wanna say Brig is probably the most fun support to play for me. I have always loved defensive heavy builds but she needs a buff imo. It’s hard to enjoy her on a comp level as other supports are just much more dominate. She’s in this weird no man’s land where she is not really as useful as others in there categories. What I mean by this is she gets out healed by numerous other supports, she has a huge handicap for putting out damage/securing kills (have to be melee range/she also just doesn’t hit hard in general), and finally her shield is super squishy while it’s handy in certain situations you get melted very fast unless your whole team dives(and no I’m not on the frontline with her). I would like to see her have a buff defensively. What she could be good at is healing and just being able to survive but takes a hit offensively where her whip shot specifically doesn’t do the same damage but maybe you can throw it out twice as often just for the sheer fact that’s your main way to proc inspire. I’d like to see maybe a hp buff or a shield hp buff at the very least. Possibly no on this and having her shield regen hp faster while also being in use would be acceptable instead of an hp buff(shield currently only regens when not in use). I would just like to see her used merely as a defensive fortification where you heal allies and mitigate damage with your shield but not being offensively dominant. All I know is currently she’s fun to play but lacks compared to others and needs changing imo. I get she was insanely overpowered back in the day. What changes would you give her that make her better while also maintaining balance?

Needless to say, we were overrun and **LITERALLY** spawn locked. I was trying to pick their healers from the safety of the spawn room, but apparently dealing damage from inside it doesn’t count as being an active player…

2025-06-02 17:14:26,832 - INFO - Content: I asked all of the Overwatch Main Subs to rank their character's difficulty on a 1 to 5 scale. Here are the results.
Overall for the most part, I am pleasantly surprised with how this turned out. And it was really fun to read all of the responses from dedicated players. That being said, here are some quick things I just want to point out.

I did not specify rank - Anytime someone mentioned their rank, at the lowest end I saw platinum players voice themselves. The highest was from a few champions. I wanted to attempt to get a mixed bag of results.

I didn't include Cassidy and Sojourn on the graph because I honestly forgot to put them on. But I have their players rankings nonetheless. 

**Cassidy - 2.75**

**Sojourn - 2.25**

I'm sorry to anyone who got bombarded by my posts yesterday. I did not think people would end up seeing  ten+ different posts. And no, I was not karma farming. 

Personal Thoughts - What I did NOT expect was how Moira's mains ranked her. I expected a lot of them to say two or three, and explain proceed to explain that fade jumps are difficult or something. But all of them were straight up like "yeah she's easy lol." The two I did not expect to be so high up were Sombra and Hanzo. And I expected Freja to be higher, since the dev team literally stated she would be one of the hardest characters play on the roster. So that mindset was initially in many players heads. So I definitely did not expect to see her that low on the overall board. 

[My favorite response](https://www.reddit.com/r/JunkRatMains/comments/1l0zzdl/how_would_you_rank_junkrats_difficulty_on_a_1_to/) was in JunkratMains, and the top comment has convinced me that Junkrat is one of the best designed characters in the game now lol.

2025-06-02 19:12:08,314 - INFO - Content: I asked all of the Overwatch Main Subs to rank their character's difficulty on a 1 to 5 scale. Here are the results.
Overall for the most part, I am pleasantly surprised with how this turned out. And it was really fun to read all of the responses from dedicated players. That being said, here are some quick things I just want to point out.

I did not specify rank - Anytime someone mentioned their rank, at the lowest end I saw platinum players voice themselves. The highest was from a few champions. I wanted to attempt to get a mixed bag of results.

I didn't include Cassidy and Sojourn on the graph because I honestly forgot to put them on. But I have their players rankings nonetheless. 

**Cassidy - 2.75**

**Sojourn - 2.25**

I'm sorry to anyone who got bombarded by my posts yesterday. I did not think people would end up seeing  ten+ different posts. And no, I was not karma farming. 

Personal Thoughts - What I did NOT expect was how Moira's mains ranked her. I expected a lot of them to say two or three, and explain proceed to explain that fade jumps are difficult or something. But all of them were straight up like "yeah she's easy lol." The two I did not expect to be so high up were Sombra and Hanzo. And I expected Freja to be higher, since the dev team literally stated she would be one of the hardest characters play on the roster. So that mindset was initially in many players heads. So I definitely did not expect to see her that low on the overall board. 

[My favorite response](https://www.reddit.com/r/JunkRatMains/comments/1l0zzdl/how_would_you_rank_junkrats_difficulty_on_a_1_to/) was in JunkratMains, and the top comment has convinced me that Junkrat is one of the best designed characters in the game now lol.

2025-06-02 20:46:50,700 - INFO - Content: The grammar of this pisses me off almost as much as the fact that someone left.
There should be a comma after "leaving" so that it reads:

>Due to a player leaving, this competitive match...

The way it's currently worded, it looks like "this competitive match" is connected to "due to a player leaving," not "will shutdown in 10 seconds." That is, it looks like it's saying this:

>Due to a player leaving this competitive match ***it*** will shutdown in 10 seconds."

But there's no "it," so the flow is weird. And honestly, that one could even do with a comma after "match."

Not to mention that "shutdown" is a noun (like, "we beat them so hard that it was a shutdown!"), but it's operating as a verb in that sentence. It should be two words: "shut down."

Please fix this, Blizzard, for it hurts my English major soul.

2025-06-03 08:22:57,791 - INFO - Content: Kiriko and Hanzo now have an unique ultimate voiceline for their mythics.
Well I'm saying now, but maybe it was implemented in an earlier patch and no one really noticed.

Kiriko says "Let my sunlight guide you"

And Hanzo says....well he says something different, most likely "Let vengeance consume you" in japanese.

So Ashe is the only hero left that still uses the regular ultimate voice line for her mythic. (While your allies do hear something unique, being "Destroy them, BOB !", the one playing Ashe still hears the regular ultimate voice line)

2025-06-03 12:32:22,346 - INFO - Content: Overwatch is fun for me again
I went through phases of being really into ow1, but after ow2 came out the game just wasn’t fun for me anymore and I didn’t play it much at all

I returned recently to try it out and the changes that they’ve made have gotten me addicted again so it’s good to see this game is going in the right direction

1. Free hero unlocks are very important and I’m glad they realized this. I don’t want to spend tons of time doing stupid challenges to unlock heroes

2. Regenerating health: this is something that I’ve always wished overwatch had and found it frustrating to not be in the game so another major improvement for me

3. Hero bans in ranked: good addition that is very standard in ranked modes for most games

4. Dps anti heal: another downside  of ow was that the ttk could feel way too long because healing is strong so having some anti heal is definitely a good thing, otherwise you just feel like your damage is absolutely pointless 

5. Perks: at first i didn’t think I would like perks but now I think they’re pretty good, offers some more variety and playstyle choice

6. Stadium: seems like a solid concept and definitely good that they added something to give us a new experience, only played 1 game of this so far I’ve just been playing ranked

I would like to say good job to the developers for making this game fun again with some smart changes and decisions

So, out of all the bad shit that has happened with Blizzard and how bad they can be, it is genuinely awesome that Overwatch is a very loudly pro queer game. That the face of OW1 was a lesbian, or that Soldier, the most 'Call of Duty' character in this game is gay and the CoD players will just have to accept it, is a nice thing about this game, to giving us plenty of pride makers/icons/player backgrounds (i forget what they are called, the long rectangle image that goes next to your name in a comp match)

I really want to give props to this, because the only other multiplayer game that I play frequently is Helldivers 2, and unfortunatly Arrowhead - the developers of that game - have shown themselves to be a huge pussy because they won't put a pride flag on because they're scared their homophobic players will stop playing the game.

It's going to get more and more common for big IPs to tone down on the gay representation in the coming years because the three most powerful governments in the world all fucking hate queers, so I hope OW stays the course.

Happy Pride!

At first I was like “okay, maybe they’re friends with the same usernames, not out of the ordinary.”

NOPE. Turns out this guy is running TWO XBOXS TO PLAY FUCKING OVERWATCH.

Now you may say, “oh, you don’t know that they’re the same person.” 

It was so deadly clear they were the same. 

He would play Ashe first, hide Cassidy in a corner, and then whenever Ashe died, he’d pick up on Cassidy. 

The worst part is, it was stadium.

 No, that wasn’t THE WORST PART. the whole time our tank and other support were complaining that Cassidy sucked. HMMM I WONDER WHY?

Then our rein started to be toxic saying “gg no team” after we lost THE VERY FIRST ROUND. HMM I WONDER TF WHY

we did eventually turn it around, ended the game off at 3-4. We could’ve won if that one person didn’t decide to play two different characters.

I reported them on Overwatch and Xbox. 
Doubtful anything will happen on Xbox, but I’m praying something happens on OW.

While watching a replay I was flabbergasted by how far her biotic grasp can reach. Am I just too noob or is this really kinda messed up? I read online that it can reach up to 20m, which is crazy to me

This tier list is me ranking how interested I’d be watching a cinematic based off on the character. My rationale for the ranking is if this character has a lot of lore that needs to be explored, or just needs some time in the light, the higher the ranking. The lower the ranking, either I believe their lore has been explored enough via mini comics and short stories, narratively not worth expanding upon in a cinematic, or I think their character is just flat-out disinteresting. 

I know some characters introduced in Overwatch 2 (Not the new launch heroes) have already technically been represented in an animated short, but let’s just put on our thinking caps for a second an have some fun!

2025-06-04 20:14:08,811 - INFO - Content: Why are some people so obsessed with whether or not a hero takes skill?
I see it quite a bit in game, people go off on each other about playing characters that take "no skill" or "less skill" than the character they are playing. They died to a Junkrat as Sojourn? Well, he's no skill, so....

It seems like they only think characters you have to aim with require skill. Ashe, Cassidy, Widowmaker, Sojourn, Tracer, Ana, Bap, etc.

I think these people forgot that this is a video game and we are supposed to be having fun. It's okay to dislike a character, but when it extends to harassing their players, that's a bit TOO far.

Hey every one!, i made this fan art based on the new concept of Widowmaker with Cammy, I'm not sure if we should say Widowmaker cosplaying Cammy, or Cammy cosplaying Widowmaker, but either way, i love Widowmaker and i find Cammy a very interesting character designed, so i def wanted to make a fan art of her.

I’m genuinely so sick of whiny teammates crying about one team having more or less heal stats than the other as if that’s our only job.

zen is not going to have the same healing as lifeweaver or mercy 

moira is going to have high damage because that’s how she refills her resource 

ana isn’t going to use her nade just to heal you, it’s there to also disable the other teams healing 

THINK before you start crying

So I killed the Junkrat and waiting for the Mercy to go in for a rez, but she did this tech where she jumps a bit further onto the bus and rez him where I can't even reach. 

When I play Mercy and rez someone and move a bit further than their death spot, I got cancelled right away. This distance feels very illegal. It's funny how the Mercy actually pinged me in the replay and her teammates are oblivious.

I’m genuinely so sick of whiny teammates crying about one team having more or less heal stats than the other as if that’s our only job.

zen is not going to have the same healing as lifeweaver or mercy 

moira is going to have high damage because that’s how she refills her resource 

ana isn’t going to use her nade just to heal you, it’s there to also disable the other teams healing 

THINK before you start crying

To the tank who threw;  
Genuinely, and from the bottom of my heart - **Thank you.**

It's 1am for me.  
Tonight's been the first night I've been able to play comp' since I had my baby and I had to stay up late to do so, my husband said he'd comfort our wee one if he woke up crying.  
  
Halfway into the first round of a comp game, my son starts crying and my husband goes off to soothe him but is clearly struggling - End of the first round I ask in match chat if it's okay if we make round 2 a quick one as my husband's struggling to get wee one back to bed, I don't care if it's a win or a loss as long as it's quick.

Enemy Winton, to the great upset of his Ana basically threw the round and the whole game as our team had won the first round to let me relieve my husband of duty and get back to my son. 

I couldn't let this good deed go unnoticed before heading off to bed.  
So again, to the tank who threw...   
**Thank you.**

2025-06-07 04:44:14,949 - INFO - Content: What's something that took you an embarrassingly long time to figure out or realize?
Overwatch is a pretty complex game. I played a ton of OW1, but didn't play much after the implementation of the role queue. Then, I installed it again this month and wow I'm hooked like I was 6-7 years ago in large part due to Stadium. I decided to gun for the challenge which requires you to win one game with every hero. I'm an Ana/support main, played a decent amount of all of them except Illari and Juno which I hadn't touch at all before.

Back to Stadium, I really struggled with Juno to get that "W" which surprises me because her kit seemed pretty nice and I main supports in general. I was going full on torpedo build after reading some tier lists mentioning it as the clear W, yet my healing output was fairly low, I would only sometimes out heal Anas or Lucios. Then, comes yesterday evening. While playing Stadium on Junker Queen, I was alone pushing the cart with Juno after winning a close team fight, and then I realized that she was shooting at me and... healing me. 

So I now want to take a moment to apologize to all these stadium teammates I watched die in front of me because I had torpedo on cooldown. To all these teammates who watched me choosing to try to snipe an Ashe instead of healing them, I'm sorry.

Literally every single game has an Ana in it, I can't escape the devil grandma. Sleep + Nade is my sleep paralysis demon. Sometimes I just wanna be able to play the the game without the mental fatigue of not being able to play the game every 16 seconds lol.

Real talk I don't know how Ana is even fun anymore for the Ana mains. Surely sleep + nade the enemy tank on cooldown is boring as heck.

(Also real talk Ana isn't that difficult of a hero anymore and the fact her own mains rated her a 4/5 for difficulty is funny)

Literally every single game has an Ana in it, I can't escape the devil grandma. Sleep + Nade is my sleep paralysis demon. Sometimes I just wanna be able to play the the game without the mental fatigue of not being able to play the game every 16 seconds lol.

Real talk I don't know how Ana is even fun anymore for the Ana mains. Surely sleep + nade the enemy tank on cooldown is boring as heck.

(Also real talk Ana isn't that difficult of a hero anymore and the fact her own mains rated her a 4/5 for difficulty is funny)

I really liked Mercy's new skin and wanted to make something similar for Juno. I took a lot of inspiration from medieval fashion so she's not as modern looking compared to Mercy's, which i think is fine.

Okay so I was trying to do some warm ups for comp matches okay? Figure “let me go 6v6 can’t hurt” but it hurt. It hurt so bad i chose support and what happens? I have to take custody of 5 DPS. Mind you nobody said anything in the match JUST ME. now I’m not complaining but I kid you not, we won the match. And I am speechless 3 to almost 4 years of playing Overwatch 2 (yes 2) I never expected this. Makes me really feel the pain for the support mains.

2025-06-07 10:15:49,417 - INFO - Content: The lifeweaver kissing voice line is the single best cosmetic to have been added to this game since 2016.
I stand by it. 

I love this voice line. It is utterly and perfectly hilarious. The first time I heard that voice line it was my lifeweaver using it to thank me after I defended him from a wreckingball as Brig. I thought I imagined it, but every time I saved him he gave me a big kiss. 

I think the thematic of lifeweaver pulling you to him to give you a kiss is actually hysterical. I don't care how terrible the pull was, if it comes with a kiss it's worth it. 

Sometimes me and the enemy lifeweaver will share petal platforms and make out while we heal our team... Truly the peak of gameplay. 

This cosmetic has brought me genuine joy. I don't know who came up with it, but you should give them a raise.

2025-06-07 23:38:49,012 - INFO - Content: Banned for "cheating" after using Freya’s wallhack perk — support won't clarify
Hey all,

I’m a long-time Overwatch player since OW1 and recently ran into a really frustrating and confusing situation with Blizzard support. About a month ago, I was permanently banned from Overwatch 2 with no warning and no clear explanation — just a generic email citing the Code of Conduct and a violation of the EULA.

Though they did not disclose the reason, I had a strong feeling that it was for cheating due to the most recent game I had played. It was a very lengthy 6v6 ranked placement on Eichenwald, both teams full capped so it ended up going for 4 rounds, and by the end we had won, and I had my personal record kills ever in a match, almost 80. By the end of the game at least 4 players on the enemy team confirmed that they believed I was cheating and reported me, some citing ESP. The worst thing about this is that I was playing Freya and using her "tracking instinct" perk, which literally **gives you wallhacks** on half health players. Throughout the game, there were many instances where this perk let me get an easy prefire kills that I wouldn't normally be able to get, some of which directly resulted in match chat hackusations.

Naturally, I appealed it, thinking it was a mistake. I made many attempts but every support ticket I opened was closed almost immediately with what seemed like copy-pasted replies. No specifics were ever given, just that the ban was for a violation and they wouldn’t go into detail.

It was only after filing a data request, I finally saw what Blizzard had internally labeled the ban as: “**cheating**.” This confirmed my suspicions that my ban was likely the result of the enemy team mass reporting me during that Eichenwald game. This was far from the first time someone has accused me of cheating in game, but as a longstanding legitimate player, I always laughed them off. I have never cheated; no third-party software, no scripts, no hardware macros, nothing.

I politely asked for a human re-review, clarification, or even just what category of cheating it supposedly was (e.g. automation, wallhacks, etc.), but got nothing back beyond more copy-paste denials and a refusal to discuss it further.

I’ll include some images below showing the initial email, ticket replies, and the data logs that label the offense as “cheating.”

[https://imgur.com/a/xIdP4FT](https://imgur.com/a/xIdP4FT)

I’m not posting this expecting Blizzard to reverse the ban here — I know that’s not how this works — but I *am* genuinely wondering:

* Has this happened to anyone else recently?
* Is there a known false positive issue going around?
* Any advice from people who’ve navigated this before?

I know it’s easy to assume “if you got banned, you probably cheated,” and I get that skepticism. But I’m being 100% real — this has left me completely confused and disappointed.

Thanks for reading. If anyone has insight, I’d really appreciate it.

Edit: Pasting in a comment I made for better visibility  
  
I forgot to mention it in the post, but its definitely worth mentioning as it regards the hero I had been playing pretty much every game: Freja. There is a bug that is currently still on the live patch that miscalculates your "take aim" accuracy. I think it has to do with the game registering the explosion as a hit in addition to the direct hit, whatever the cause is, the game consistently overmultiplies your take aim accuracy. It is easily replicable, my friend was able to go into the custom game "VAXTA" and achieve impossible take aim accuracies (over 100% seen 135%, might be infinitely stackable) while still missing shots. I do not know for sure if Freja was still functioning like this 1 month ago, but it is definitely noteworthy as it could make any players stats seem like those of a cheater when put under scrutiny.

2025-06-08 07:14:50,242 - INFO - Content: Banned for "cheating" after using Freya’s wallhack perk — support won't clarify
Hey all,

I’m a long-time Overwatch player since OW1 and recently ran into a really frustrating and confusing situation with Blizzard support. About a month ago, I was permanently banned from Overwatch 2 with no warning and no clear explanation — just a generic email citing the Code of Conduct and a violation of the EULA.

Though they did not disclose the reason, I had a strong feeling that it was for cheating due to the most recent game I had played. It was a very lengthy 6v6 ranked placement on Eichenwald, both teams full capped so it ended up going for 4 rounds, and by the end we had won, and I had my personal record kills ever in a match, almost 80. By the end of the game at least 4 players on the enemy team confirmed that they believed I was cheating and reported me, some citing ESP. The worst thing about this is that I was playing Freya and using her "tracking instinct" perk, which literally **gives you wallhacks** on half health players. Throughout the game, there were many instances where this perk let me get easy prefire kills that I wouldn't normally be able to get, some of which directly resulted in match chat hackusations.

Naturally, I appealed it, thinking it was a mistake. I made many attempts but every support ticket I opened was closed almost immediately with what seemed like copy-pasted replies. No specifics were ever given, just that the ban was for a violation and they wouldn’t go into detail.

It was only after filing a data request, I finally saw what Blizzard had internally labeled the ban as: “**cheating**.” This confirmed my suspicions that my ban was likely the result of the enemy team mass reporting me during that Eichenwald game. This was far from the first time someone has accused me of cheating in game, but as a longstanding legitimate player, I always laughed them off. I have never cheated; no third-party software, no scripts, no hardware macros, nothing.

I politely asked for a human re-review, clarification, or even just what category of cheating it supposedly was (e.g. automation, wallhacks, etc.), but got nothing back beyond more copy-paste denials and a refusal to discuss it further.

I’ll include some images below showing the initial email, ticket replies, and the data logs that label the offense as “cheating.”

I’m not posting this expecting Blizzard to reverse the ban here — I know that’s not how this works — but I *am* genuinely wondering:

* Has this happened to anyone else recently?
* Is there a known false positive issue going around?
* Any advice from people who’ve navigated this before?

I know it’s easy to assume “if you got banned, you probably cheated,” and I get that skepticism. But I’m being 100% real — this has left me completely confused and disappointed.

Thanks for reading. If anyone has insight, I’d really appreciate it.

Edit: Pasting in a comment I made for better visibility  
  
I forgot to mention it in the post, but its definitely worth mentioning as it regards the hero I had been playing pretty much every game: Freja. There is a bug that is currently still on the live patch that miscalculates your "take aim" accuracy. I think it has to do with the game registering the explosion as a hit in addition to the direct hit, whatever the cause is, the game consistently overmultiplies your take aim accuracy. It is easily replicable, my friend was able to go into the custom game "VAXTA" and achieve impossible take aim accuracies (over 100% seen 135%, might be infinitely stackable) while still missing shots. I do not know for sure if Freja was still functioning like this 1 month ago, but it is definitely noteworthy as it could make any players stats seem like those of a cheater when put under scrutiny.

2025-06-08 08:19:40,786 - INFO - Content: If Freja can have 225hp, then so can Sojourn
Lots of discussions around Freja's balance currently, but one thing stands out - the devs ARE willing to make high damage, high mobility heroes 225hp... unless it's Sojourn.

I could spend all day talking about the absurdity of Sojourn being allowed to exist in this broken state for pretty much all of OW2s existence, but that's already been said enough. 

Freja being 225hp makes sense. Good mobility + good damage output balanced with less survivability. But Sojourn is literally just Freja with one shot potential (and slightly worse but still good mobility). The fact that she hasn't been brought down to 225 is just... puzzling. The devs KNOW 225 is the right number for these kind of heroes... yet Sojourn is *always* a special exception.

Please... there isn't really an excuse as to why Sojourn can't be 225HP when Freja is.

(In before the Sojourn buffs next season)

You guys are always the nicest tanks, no complains there, but I wish you guys at least didn’t stand behind walls after throwing yourself to the opposite side of the map 💜

2025-06-08 23:14:50,240 - INFO - Content: Stadium rank is a poor indicator of skill
People keep posting about a game being bad \*because\* their teammate was a lower Stadium rank than them, but I really don't think that's how it works. Just look at how it's set up:

\- You lose no rank for loses in the first two divisions

\- You lose WAY less than you gain in the second two divisions

\- Consecutive wins grants massive rank in Elite and below

\- Rank reset each season

\- \*\*RANK RESETS EACH SEASON\*\*

\- Special seasonal cosmetics for reaching high ranks

I'm sorry, but you can't look at this and honestly tell me it's a serious ranked system that accurately represents your skill. It's not and it doesn't. It's an engagement-oriented system that encourages a seasonal mad dash to get as high as you can, get the seasonal cosmetics, and then do it again next season.

When Stadium first launched, they said the matchmaker didn't consider your Stadium rank. Then a little while later, someone said that it did consider your stadium rank. So now I'm not sure which of those two people were misinformed, but I think the truth should be obvious just by looking at what we know.

There is not a snowball's chance in hell that this goofy system offers any serious contribution to matchmaking. It's far more likely that it uses your MMR with Stadium rank as a light modifier.

I wanted to make a short follow up to my previous post to share my progress.
At 2:30pm today I got an email from blizzard titled Overwatch - Closure Overturned and it contained the message attached above. I did not need to make any additional tickets, it seems that the publicity alone was enough to get someone to look into my case and overturn the cheating ban. For that I thank everyone for interacting and sharing to help my problem get seen by the right people, I am truly grateful.

2025-06-09 13:28:51,610 - INFO - Content: Endorsements got done dirty.
Endorsements are probably one of the best features for player interactivity and rewarding good behaviour in the whole game and it kinda sucks how they got downgraded.

Ow1 used to have different categories of endorsements. Getting a "Good Teammate" or especially "Shot caller" from someone always felt earned, but now when i get endorsed i'm just wondering why. Was it because i was a good team mate, or because i didn't participate in the Team's infight in chat?

They really should've doubled down on the different kinds of endorsements and give enemy players unique ones, rather than just Sportsmanship, like "worthy opponent" or "best frienemy" for the ones that either defended you in chat or were just fun to play against.

It just sucks that this system fell off so hard. Now you don't even know why exactly you get endorsed and not knowing WHO endorsed you makes it even more of a mystery.

It's kinda crazy to me how the "removal" of the On Fire mechanic was complained about until they readded it, but i haven't seen anyone say anything about how endorsement just got objectively worse.

2025-06-10 10:45:13,772 - INFO - Content: MR showed me just how well Overwatch is made
I still like overwatch 1 way better than 2. As much as I was enjoying MR it always seemed something off. Overwatch has better art style, graphics, gunplay feel, physics, sound design, original characters and new reveals excitement plus better balancing. Call me old school but I liked when overwatch 1 didn’t constantly get updates and balance changes. 

Tbh MR just feels like a mobile game developed quickly and scaled up for consoles mid development. They didn’t have faith in themselves the game would do good and said were surprised by millions of players. Not to mention how busy MR ui feels now. 

Overwatch 1 devs were confidence enough in the game to charge $40 - $60 and free heroes, events and skins after.

So if im playing moira and i accidently get this perk it feel like im throwing. that half a sec feels like forever and if i fade to dodge an ult or whatever but my team took heavy dps.  
  
 i need to heal them but im stuck doing nothing for an extra half a sec. just watching my team perish from a monkey slowly tickling them to death. 

i feel like it either needs a cancel option or some kind of diff perk option. maybe like when she fades she bursts ppl around her for around 50 HP since her whole kit is heal/dps. or maybe a stationary heal ball like a  turret they ppl have to be near.

Hey guys, so I was a long time OW player since 2016, ended up leaving the game to play MR but now after seeing MR rerelease pretty much all of their exclusive skins it has me thinking, what skins are still exclusive in Overwatch? I’ve done some research about rare skins like obviously Alien Zarya and Noire Widow, but i’ve been super out of the loop regarding overwatch news. What i’ve heard is that they’ve brought lootboxes back to the game, and in turn have brought a lot of these formerly ‘rare’ skins back to now just being normal skins. Now the unfortunate part is that most of the lists of skins and articles regarding these rare skins are now dating at 1-2 years old, and aren’t really telling me what’s considered ‘rare’ anymore. So current OW friends, what skins were not brought back in loot boxes and are considered rare? and What skins are back in lootboxes and are no longer considered rare?

Splitting extended Europe into half with Northern hemisphere and Southern hemisphere and comparing hero representation.

🟦 **Total: 10 heroes from North**

* **Brigitte**: Sweden
* **Torbjörn**: Sweden
* **Reinhardt**: Germany
* **Bastion:** Germany (Eichenwalde)
* **Mercy:** Switzerland
* **Moira:** Ireland
* **Sigma:** Netherlands
* **Widowmaker:** France
* **Tracer:** United Kingdom
* Ingrid Lindholm and Emily (Lore)
* Ramattra: UK (Lore)

🟥 **Total: 0 heroes from South**

 (No representation from Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Turkey etc)

Comparing the population of the regions 

Northern hem Total: **\~314.1 million**

Southern hem Total: **\~349 million**

I won't go over Northern America having 7 heroes either.   
  
Most games are beginning to put more attention to Southern EU and Middle East to not isolate player-bases, all new characters. Notable examples include: Valorant (Fade - Turkey) , Rainbow Six (Skopós - Greece) , Apex Legends (Sparrow - Italy), Street Fighter (Marisa - Italy/Greece), Tekken  (Claudio - Italy, Miguel - Spain)

# Why the imbalance?

In conclusion, Overwatch has by far the most misrepresented heroes of any major title.

2025-06-12 19:12:24,654 - INFO - Content: Overwatch Community Collab Wishlist: Day 28-Hammond/Wrecking Ball
Winry Rockbell from **Full Metal Alchemist** is the winner for [Day 27](https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1l90hbp/overwatch_community_collab_wishlist_day_27brigitte/)'s Brigitte skin! Staring off the 4th column now we have Hammond-Also known as Wrecking Ball! What would be your dream collab skin for the l'il guy? Remember before you cast your vote there's just a few rules we've gotta go through first.

Rule #1-No repeats, That means you can't vote for a collab skin that someone else has already either in game or on the Wishlist-So that means no Thanos Hammond and no Izuku Midoriya Hammond either. 

Rule #2-The comment with the singular most upvotes will win, you can still show your support of course in the comments but only the single comment with the most upvotes will win-So if you see someone whose commented the same idea as you then make sure to give them an upvote!

Rule #3-No in universe skins-This is a collab Wishlist after all so giving Hammond a mirrorwatch skin or something wouldn't be a crossover-If a skin like this wins again like with the Genji inspired Hanzo skin then I'll still give it an honourable mention and can add it to the pic if you all really want but the winner will be the most upvoted **collab** skin.

With the rules out of the way let's begin Day 28! Happy voting everybody!

2025-06-13 10:17:14,767 - INFO - Content: Overwatch is truly a great game
I was watching some of the old cinematics of Overwatch, just reminiscing at how big a part of my life it has been and how incredible it is that the game is still going. Regardless of the corporate issues, the long delay in development, the unfulfilled promises, at it’s core, Overwatch is and always has been, at every point in its existence a truly great game.

When you read all the lore, watch the cinematics, read the comics and the books and focus on all the character interactions, it’s all so much more potent. 

I hope this game has a long and enduring lifetimes, stays as alive as it and gets even more popular and goes down as truly one of the greats in the history of gaming, despite everything that has happened and may happen.

Hi, this is my first post ever and I’m so excited :D I commissioned someone to make an Ana doll for me, she redid the makeup, did the hair and the clothes and shoes and hat and even threw in a chocolate bar and a sniper rifle as a freebie + the stand for the doll! She’s super awesome and so talented and super sweet, I’m not sure if I’m allowed to “promote” / “plug” her Instagram so I won’t but if you’re interested just lmk! Also ignore all the clutter behind, sorry !!

2025-06-14 01:13:03,510 - INFO - Content: You know you're not supposed to be able to outheal damage, right?
I'm seeing a lot of negative reaction to the upcoming dps passive buff which is honestly puzzling to me. Sustain is through the roof and often (as has been for years, especially at higher ranks) dps feels like the least impactful role outside of burst damage outliers like freja and sojourn. The dps passive gives sustained dps heroes a chance to actually perform their role and  eliminate targets. Before the dps passive, when playing a hero like Symmetra or Soldier it was tremendously hard to kill anything with even full beam because of how much healing was in the game. You'd feel permanently outclassed by any hero that could burst you down in a second. 

Players need to use cover and time their disengages directly. You should not be able to sit there and facetank damage ad infinitum while being healed. The game was never designed that way. Otherwise the only things that would kill would be oneshots and high burst.

Honestly, the dps passive is one of the best things about ow2.

DPS passive increase once again? Can't wait to explode for peeking a corner!

(The DPS passive will be 15% now for tanks, which doesn't sound like alot, but that was literally the original universal value. It got nerfed from 15 because tanks were exploding. Not sure how this is gonna go down)

2025-06-14 08:18:40,646 - INFO - Content: My boyfriend just lent me his playstation 4 and he wants to play overwatch with me, I want to impress him, I need a tip or something that only experienced players know
I want to be able to have him teach me but do something a beginner player wouldn’t know? I’ve never played Overwatch so I don’t know if there’s anything like this, I just want to be able to catch him off guard and surprise him with a little something?
