I’ve come to make an announcement: The Overwatch Dev Team’s a bitch-ass motherfucker, they pissed on my fucking wife! That’s right, they took their greedyfuckin’ blizzard dick out and they pissed on my fucking wife, and they said their widow buffs were “this big,” and I said “that’s disgusting,”

Recently went against a Freja that picked the power where she fires a mini ult every time she updrafts. She built full AP and CD... Our team couldn't even move. Honestly, I don't understand why they thought bringing the newest hero to the stadium was a good idea.

If anything the Classic mode shows how far we've come since the end of OW1's life, double sheild, Sombra hack that lasts 2 years, Bastion ,only 8 tanks is surprizing we've reached the level of fun we have now.

I really like sombra as a character mostly because of her personality but i really dislike her gameplay not because she is strong but rather because she is annoying and the fact that the majority of people playing her actually want to be a pain does not help.

99$ for Overwatch skins or $120 For basically 15 Full and Complete Street Fighter games. I'm not going to make any actual comments on my opinions of their marketing strategy lately.... but this honestly feels insane. And this is coming from someone who has spent countless $ on this game, both in copies of the game, loot boxes for me and friends, and skins/collabs purchased. More and more it goes from feeling like i'm supporting the game or supplementing my enjoyment through small purchases... to they trying to milk people as much as they can for as long as they can.

It seemed like every single day there was a thread about how only low Metal ranks are banning Sombra and the “good” players don’t really ban her that much because “she’s easy to deal with.” 

Now the ban data has dropped and she’s the second most banned DPS in Masters+.

Beg for forgiveness… lol

I turned it off almost immediately when Kiri (or Overwatch 2 for that matter) was released and I've never turned it back on because I for one have never considered it to be valuable. After all, it's an unlimited resource that tracks allies with virtually no effort. I've never been like "Wait, do I have enough healing ofuda for this engagement?"

I have soft spot for fighting games so I did bought the **Ultra Bundle** for SF6 Collab event, but I'm quite disspointed with how the skin was chosen to do for Widowmaker x Cammy, So I put some effort to edit and paint over the short pant out,   
This is about doing it right  (• - •)ゝ  
Also both games are "Rated T for Teen" this should be fine.

I have soft spot for fighting games so I did bought the **Ultra Bundle** for SF6 Collab event, but I'm quite disspointed with how the skin was chosen to do for Widowmaker x Cammy, So I put some effort to edit and paint over the short pant out,   
This is about doing it right  (• - •)ゝ  
Also both games are "Rated T for Teen" this should be fine.

Just yesterday my account got banned for cheating after I had played a few rounds of stadium, one where I was playing Kiriko using the Clone jutsu ability. People started calling me a cheater in chat and I got very confused. After talking to customer support, it seems there's a fault in the system where in the killcams of people dying to the clone Kiriko, all they see is you, aimbotting. 

This caused my Day 1 account with a few thousand hours to get banned, luckily it all got fixed within about 24 hours. Just giving people playing Stadium a heads up that picking the Clone power with Kiriko could result in a ban

Just yesterday my account got banned for cheating after I had played a few rounds of stadium, one where I was playing Kiriko using the Clone jutsu ability. People started calling me a cheater in chat and I got very confused. After talking to customer support, it seems there's a fault in the system where in the killcams of people dying to the clone Kiriko, all they see is you, aimbotting. 

This caused my Day 1 account with a few thousand hours to get banned, luckily it all got fixed within about 24 hours. Just giving people playing Stadium a heads up that picking the Clone power with Kiriko could result in a ban

i was thinking of doing more of these, like ok computer echo or kid a hazard, but i feel like i can connect the album's meanings / story to the characters rather than basing it off of visuals alone. but at the same time pretty = pretty so

2025-05-28 19:35:53,733 - INFO - Content: Freya is making the game unenjoyable
Am I tripping or does anyone else feel the same way?

Before, there was the option to escape to stadium from this hero, but now even that's gone.

Every single game, jumping around, disabling like 70% of the roster who can't deal with flying heroes, and then having to pick miserable characters to have a chance to counter her.

The same argument could be made for Pharah or Echo, but atleast they are shootable, Freya just dashes with her laughable hitbox left and right, which makes it basically impossible to hit her in the air if the player has atleast a three digit IQ.

I've been enjoying overwatch in the past few months and looked forward to play every time, but it's gotten to a point where I log on in the afternoon, and the excitement is gone, it's literally only "How many games can I play today before a Freya just sucks the joy out of the whole thing and just makes me stop"

I'm not just talking about her being strong like the 10 thousand people before me , Sojourn is strong, Roadhog is strong, a couple heroes are strong, but Freya is straight up a misery to play against. 

I've been playing this game for a while but this is an absolute first for me, not even a good Sombra or Ball or any typical annoying character makes me feel THIS miserable on sight. I just see the character and immediately regret turning on the game.
