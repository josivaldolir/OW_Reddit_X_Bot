I’ve come to make an announcement: The Overwatch Dev Team’s a bitch-ass motherfucker, they pissed on my fucking wife! That’s right, they took their greedyfuckin’ blizzard dick out and they pissed on my fucking wife, and they said their widow buffs were “this big,” and I said “that’s disgusting,”

Recently went against a Freja that picked the power where she fires a mini ult every time she updrafts. She built full AP and CD... Our team couldn't even move. Honestly, I don't understand why they thought bringing the newest hero to the stadium was a good idea.

If anything the Classic mode shows how far we've come since the end of OW1's life, double sheild, Sombra hack that lasts 2 years, Bastion ,only 8 tanks is surprizing we've reached the level of fun we have now.

I really like sombra as a character mostly because of her personality but i really dislike her gameplay not because she is strong but rather because she is annoying and the fact that the majority of people playing her actually want to be a pain does not help.

99$ for Overwatch skins or $120 For basically 15 Full and Complete Street Fighter games. I'm not going to make any actual comments on my opinions of their marketing strategy lately.... but this honestly feels insane. And this is coming from someone who has spent countless $ on this game, both in copies of the game, loot boxes for me and friends, and skins/collabs purchased. More and more it goes from feeling like i'm supporting the game or supplementing my enjoyment through small purchases... to they trying to milk people as much as they can for as long as they can.

It seemed like every single day there was a thread about how only low Metal ranks are banning Sombra and the “good” players don’t really ban her that much because “she’s easy to deal with.” 

Now the ban data has dropped and she’s the second most banned DPS in Masters+.

Beg for forgiveness… lol

I turned it off almost immediately when Kiri (or Overwatch 2 for that matter) was released and I've never turned it back on because I for one have never considered it to be valuable. After all, it's an unlimited resource that tracks allies with virtually no effort. I've never been like "Wait, do I have enough healing ofuda for this engagement?"

I have soft spot for fighting games so I did bought the **Ultra Bundle** for SF6 Collab event, but I'm quite disspointed with how the skin was chosen to do for Widowmaker x Cammy, So I put some effort to edit and paint over the short pant out,   
This is about doing it right  (• - •)ゝ  
Also both games are "Rated T for Teen" this should be fine.

I have soft spot for fighting games so I did bought the **Ultra Bundle** for SF6 Collab event, but I'm quite disspointed with how the skin was chosen to do for Widowmaker x Cammy, So I put some effort to edit and paint over the short pant out,   
This is about doing it right  (• - •)ゝ  
Also both games are "Rated T for Teen" this should be fine.

Just yesterday my account got banned for cheating after I had played a few rounds of stadium, one where I was playing Kiriko using the Clone jutsu ability. People started calling me a cheater in chat and I got very confused. After talking to customer support, it seems there's a fault in the system where in the killcams of people dying to the clone Kiriko, all they see is you, aimbotting. 

This caused my Day 1 account with a few thousand hours to get banned, luckily it all got fixed within about 24 hours. Just giving people playing Stadium a heads up that picking the Clone power with Kiriko could result in a ban

Just yesterday my account got banned for cheating after I had played a few rounds of stadium, one where I was playing Kiriko using the Clone jutsu ability. People started calling me a cheater in chat and I got very confused. After talking to customer support, it seems there's a fault in the system where in the killcams of people dying to the clone Kiriko, all they see is you, aimbotting. 

This caused my Day 1 account with a few thousand hours to get banned, luckily it all got fixed within about 24 hours. Just giving people playing Stadium a heads up that picking the Clone power with Kiriko could result in a ban

i was thinking of doing more of these, like ok computer echo or kid a hazard, but i feel like i can connect the album's meanings / story to the characters rather than basing it off of visuals alone. but at the same time pretty = pretty so

2025-05-28 19:35:53,733 - INFO - Content: Freya is making the game unenjoyable
Am I tripping or does anyone else feel the same way?

Before, there was the option to escape to stadium from this hero, but now even that's gone.

Every single game, jumping around, disabling like 70% of the roster who can't deal with flying heroes, and then having to pick miserable characters to have a chance to counter her.

The same argument could be made for Pharah or Echo, but atleast they are shootable, Freya just dashes with her laughable hitbox left and right, which makes it basically impossible to hit her in the air if the player has atleast a three digit IQ.

I've been enjoying overwatch in the past few months and looked forward to play every time, but it's gotten to a point where I log on in the afternoon, and the excitement is gone, it's literally only "How many games can I play today before a Freya just sucks the joy out of the whole thing and just makes me stop"

I'm not just talking about her being strong like the 10 thousand people before me , Sojourn is strong, Roadhog is strong, a couple heroes are strong, but Freya is straight up a misery to play against. 

I've been playing this game for a while but this is an absolute first for me, not even a good Sombra or Ball or any typical annoying character makes me feel THIS miserable on sight. I just see the character and immediately regret turning on the game.

2025-05-29 08:20:53,484 - INFO - Content: Randomly got 11k OW coins?
Hey! Last week on the 21st I bought the 11k OW coins and bought the Street Fighter 6 bundle and the new mythic weapon all through the Battle.net shop as I was on a holiday. I log in again 2 days ago for the second time this week and I have 12k coins in my account? Mind you I already bought the SF6 bundle and have played with the skins. I checked yesterday and today and it is still there. I checked my balance history and it says I didn’t buy anything, just the 10k for the SF6. The only thing though is that in the transactions it had not said that I actually bought the street fighter 6 bundle despite me owning it in game and having played it. 

I experienced this ONCE before back in 2022 when the Pacific all star skins came out, I bought the mercy one and a few hours later I see i still have the same amount of coins in my balance so I bought the DVA pacific all star skin. I never got banned or anything for spending the money too. 

Has anyone else experienced this? And do you think I’ll get banned if I spend the coins now? Because last time it happened I never got into the negatives. I am grateful that I got a good glitch though :’)

I really am tired of every match being dominated by the same two heroes, you all know who I’m talking about and they’re even more obnoxious with the mercy pocket. for the sake of my sanity can we please choose a different style for the next DPS hero

I’m a tank main and i usually do a pretty good job unless we get rolled. I had a match where our support got annoyed and threatened to report me for “feeding” even though the rest of my team was all alive and could follow behind me, when it was under my impression that tanks are supposed to create room and if nobody else is gonna push I’m gonna push, but i’ve also had games where people yell at the tank in chat for not pushing. so what am i even supposed to do?

2025-05-30 08:47:09,843 - INFO - Content: Freja's damage should be focused on the hit damage of the bomb arrows(Take aim)
To put it simple, nerf the explosion damage. ANd if you must, increase the shot damage instead.

The reason that makes Freja dangerous is her ability to shoot 2~3 bomb arrows("Take aim.") in a short amount of time.

The bomb arrow's max damage per shot is 170.(40×2+90) If it's not a crit, it would be 130.(40+90)
 
Therfore, the damage of two arrows combined would be 340(170+170, both crit), 300(170+130, half and half), 260(all body shots). 

The problem is with the third one, 260.

Most of the heroes in the Support/DPS sections are below 250 HP. Although there are other ways to survive(* Venture's passive and skills, Kiriko's cleanse and etc), these depend on the skill's availability.

The exceptions are
DPS: Bastion(250+100 Armor), Cassidy(275), Mei/Reaper(300), Symmetra(125+150 Shield), Torbjörn(225+75 Armor)
Support: Lifeweaver(225+50 Shield)

Among the 19 DPS amd 11 Supports, only 6 DPS and Lifeweaver can survive from two body shots. 

There are other DPS that share simillar traits(Small size of shot/long range) that also land burst damage in a short amount of time(Widow/Hanzo/Sojourn/Ashe), 
BUT NONE OF THEM CAN KILL A HERO with two body shots(except Hanzo).


Hanzo is the only exception, but unlike Freja, Hanzo takes at least 1.12(drawback 0.5 s+charge 0.72s)s and most importantly, affected by gravity, which makes it more difficult to land shots. Not to mention, Hanzo does not have any skills that make him "fly into midair".

Even Sojourn's railgun damage output is 120(100 energy).  

I am not saying that the max damage output of Freja should be nerfed, due to the difficulty of headshots, but the min damage should be nerfed below 225.

im WELL aware that this is a post being made every single day and people are probably tired of seeing it, but i can only hope that by sheer volume of posts, the one singular blizzard dev who looks at reddit once in a blue moon will see ONE of these posts.

i am so fucking tired of this character. she flys, and has a projectile faster than hanzo. every 2 fucking nanoseconds i have a giant arrow on my screen that sits there for a whole 3 seconds before exploding, doing like 130 damage or something around there. she has 225 hp which frankly seems a little too much. its just one of the most frusturating characters i have had the absolute displeasure of fighting. as bad if not worse than release date mauga. i am just really tired of fighting against this character. especially when someone with even a slightly decent accuracy picks her up. i just perish before i even understand what happened because she shot 2 or 3 of her giant arrows at me. even if they dont hit me directly, their fucking tsar bomba range still does.

i can just only pray this character gets heavily nerfed. i think i remember someone saying shes getting a patch soon, thats making it to where she cant do her insta kill shit AS often, but its only a lsight nerf, and she can still DO her insta kill burst. dont you love hyper mobile burst damage characters!!!

2025-05-30 15:40:56,941 - INFO - Content: Overwatch Community Collab Wishlist: Day 21-Genji
The votes for [Day 20](https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1kyfgzf/overwatch_community_collab_wishlist_day_20mei/) are in! Mei's first collab skin on this list is inspired by Velma from Scooby Doo! 

For Day 21 we have the final character in Overwatch's base roster-GenjI! What would be your dream collab skin for our favourite cyborg ninja? 

Normally I'd go over the rules next but before I do I just wanna give a quick **Hiatus Announcement**. I'm going on holiday for about a week tomorrow which unfortunately means I'm gonna have to take a l'il break from our Community Collab Wishlist while I'm gone. 

I feel like I unintentionally nailed the timing though because today we're finishing off Overwatch's base roster with Genji and then when I get back we can move on to all the characters that got added after Overwatch launched, starting with Anna! 

I hope you've enjoyed the community collab Wishlist so far and I hope you look forward to its return next week! 

Now then, with that out of the way let's go over the rules! 

Rule #1-No repeats, That means you can't vote for a collab skin that someone else has already either in game or on the Wishlist-So that means no Shovel Knight Genji and no Ryu Genji either.

Rule #2-The comment with the singular most upvotes will win, you can still show your support of course in the comments but only the single comment with the most upvotes will win-So if you see someone whose commented the same idea as you then make sure to give them an upvote!

Rule #3-No in universe skins-This is a collab Wishlist after all so giving Genji a Hanzo inspired skin or something wouldn't be a crossover-If a skin like this wins again like with the Genji inspired Hanzo skin then I'll still give it an honourable mention and can add it to the pic if you all really want but the winner will be the most upvoted **collab** skin.

With the rules out of the way let's begin Day 21! Happy voting everybody!

I don't play Hanzo or Sombra but I'm happy to say the least. The Heir skin for Hanzo is one of my favorites for him. Time to learn him perhaps?

Starting may 30th the overwatch pride event comes to celebrate lgbtq+ people and characters yet not everyone get to celebrate or enjoy the event some people were wondering why they didn't get the emote nor the skin so I figured I make this post to remind them not everyone get to celebrate pride in the game apparently the skin appears as default while the emote is just blue smoke 
here's a picture I got from a random friendly lobby

2025-05-31 03:39:08,532 - INFO - Content: Did Blizzard make Soldier 76 gay because he’s Mr. Call of Duty and Call of Duty players are all gay?
Genuinely curious. I have yet to find a game that has a higher rate of players calling me gay or a stronger urge to inform every other player that they’re gay in a video game than I have with CoD. 

Since soldier 76 was made as the cod class for those players than subsequently written as gay, I find this to be the only explanation.

(i saw them post something about it on their ig)but im not too sure, any thoughts?

2025-05-31 14:13:04,984 - INFO - Content: I'm calling it now, Freja was added just for a Masters of the Universe collab
Playing with my friend I'm joking around about a Masters of the Universe collab with Rein being He-Man, but then I realize Freja would totally be the Sorceress in that crossover. As soon as Venture was announced I was immediately telling said friend this is just a character for a Toph skin in Avatar The Last Airbender collab. Not saying I have some amazing powers of seeing in the future or insider knowledge, just saw a connection and see one now that I also use to will a Rein skin into existence. 

\- Freja as Sorceress. She just looks like she got that cape/cloak just to fit the character.

\- Reinhardt as He-Man. Come on, what other buff boi would fit it better? With Frostmourne on the Lich King skin, you got a sword model and since the Demon Lord skin season five they modeled his pecs and abs to show off.

\- Ramattra as Skeletor. He's got that Staff Skeletor often uses and can get buff to match Rein. This would also be somewhat lore-accurate since he's not a fan of Crusaders

\- Winston as Beast Man. Just kinda feels fitting. Was thinking if Roadhog would work better, but kinda feel Winston fits bit more.

\- Soldier as Man-At-Arms. This just sounds right.

\- Brigitte as Teela. She's not Junker Queen buff, but always felt tougher than usual, so think Brig fits her fine. Also, looking up for a pic for this, there's quite a bit of images of her and her figures with a melee weapon and shield. Plus, it's someone other than Kiriko.

\- Widowmaker as Evil-Lyn. I really know on this one. Didn't have anyone particular in mind for this one, but I guess Widow fits enough (works better than Cammy, if you ask me).

\- Zenyatta as Orko. This one's kind of a joke, but why not? Already floats and all. The only problem would come around with his standing emotes. Doubt they'd chop his legs off, so it'd be an Orko in sandals.
