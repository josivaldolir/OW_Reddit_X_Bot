2025-04-27 20:37:39,562 - INFO - Content: This is the best Overwatch has been in years and I’m tired of pretending it’s not


Yeah the launch of OW2 was a disaster, but I’m tired of having to pretend two years later that the game is still bad.

The current team of devs are significantly more ambitious and responsive to community woes than the OW1 team ever was. In just two seasons, the OW2 team has shown more willingness in shaking up the game and keeping it fresh than OW1 did in five years. Seriously, the only real shake-up OW1 got in that time was the introduction of role queue.

Now? Perks, hero bans, Stadium, map voting, etc. On top of that, the last four hero releases have been legitimately solid designs and great additions to the game. The game might not be what was promised, but the extent to which OW2 is a significantly better live service than OW1 needs to be studied.

Obviously the game still isn’t perfect, the monetization still sticks out as a sore point to me and I’d like to see them expand on the lore, but we’re a hell of a lot closer to that ideal now than we ever were back in the good old days.” I’m genuinely excited for the future of this game again.
