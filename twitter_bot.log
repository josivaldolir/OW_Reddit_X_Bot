2025-03-06 20:15:38,561 - INFO - Content: What is your unpopular opinions/hot takes?
Curious what other people's are tbh. 

My main one is that people hating/wanting nerfs for famously annoying characters (such as sym, torb, roadhog, junkrat etc) is reasonable. I can see characters that people find annoying taking all the fun out of the match for some people. (I personally don't have too many hated characters but they're mostly dive purely because I mainly play ana). 

Oh and that old dps passive was better. That reload and moment speed was so damn fun.

Edit: my other main one is that ow simply was never made for console. Having to pick between long range accuracy with a lowER sensitivity or being able to actually turn around while being jumped by a tracer, sombra, genji etc is insane.
