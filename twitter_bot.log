2025-04-08 08:20:40,593 - INFO - Content: Now that the season is two weeks from finishing what is everyone’s final opinion on the return of lootboxes?
Picture attached is how many lootboxes I have earned up til this point (minus one.. don’t ask) 

Over 100 lootboxes before the end of the season is insanely generous. With pity system and 3 guaranteed legendaries I have been able to confirm at minimum 8 legendary skins from lootboxes alone. Maybe more if I get lucky.

I know next season won’t be as “charitable” but damn I hope they let us have at least 50 lootboxes per season with maybe 10 lootboxes being earnable through other methods.

(I'm new to Reddit, so the image didn't show up properly—reuploading it here!)  
  
Hi everyone! I'm a Korean Overwatch player.  
I came back for Season 15, and to celebrate the LE SSERAFIM collab, I made a pixel art version in the style of MapleStory, one of my favorite games! >w<  
(Hopefully I can do something for a second collab someday too!)  
Hope you all enjoy it! That’s all from me—bye\~ :)

Why this Juno skin is so detailed. If you look closer there are muscle on her shoulders and her armplts is so detailed and don't forget the hips line too. Like what the hell if you compare this skin to other Le Serafim skins the other skins are just bland compare to the Juno skin if they just add abs this skin will be perfect I will buy this skin 2x the price. Look for Soul Fighter Samira in L3ague her splash art has abs on it and it's so good.

Of all the skins I've purchased in other games like L3ague, Warz0ne, Rlvals, This specific Juno skins is the one I've felt happy that I bought this skin unlike the skins I bought in other games like, Yeah I bought it because I don't have a skin on this hero or it's just look cool. But this one is different and this will be my top personal favorite skin of all the games I've played.

i love magical girl anime’s and have wanted themed skins around that for ages. i was so excited when my prayers were answered and  dokiwatch was announced. The artowork for the skins came out and i fell in love. if we didn’t get a magical girl season, i think a mermaid/aquatic theme could have been cool.

Just died as an Ana to a Mei who cryo-froze on top, while I dropped to below. I was still slowed down even though I had no LOS to Mei. I thought it works similar to the ult, where walls block LOS. Am I mistaken, or is this a bug?

2025-04-09 01:09:25,728 - INFO - Content: Blizzard is killing it
Blizzard just released a patch for a 2-week event. That's insane. Do you remember when we would get one mid season patch and maybe a hot fix each season? This is an incredible turnaround and it's awesome to see them listening to the community and responding so quickly.

I didn't even expect wrecking ball to return to normalwatch after the invincibility bug yet they had fixed that in around 24 hours!!!

Yes, it's not a perfect game, but it's our imperfect game. Thank you blizzard for the lootboxes, the countless free legendary skins through events/twitch drops/discord quests, thank you for making a game where me and my friends can have fun together from 1000 miles apart.

Yea, let's lose this one. I don't care anymore. If you're gonna be a garbage instalock DPS, you can have fun like that then. Enjoy not having a tank. Or a second healer. I'm so over these people lol.

I thought having another tank would alleviate the stress of being the "foundation" of your team. And that is true, but you just feel sooo weak. 

I like being the raid boss. I like charging in and not immediately exploding. Your mere presence is impactful in 5v5. And if you don't want the stress? Just queue dps or support. I think its fine there is a role that is significantly more important, you dont have to play it!

I started playing with overwatch 2, so I’ve always played 5v5. I was trying to like 6v6 since it dropped, but I’m having the worst experience, most of the games no one picks support so im the only support player trying to keep 5 ppl alive, other games no one picks tank, and there are games where we have 4 support. I’ve rarely played a 2-2-2. I try to speak to my teammates in chat but they don’t listen. Gold rank BTW, what should i do?

2025-04-09 15:42:32,294 - INFO - Content: The matchmaking is ruining the game for me
I want to start off by saying I'm a plat player, and I 100% deserve to be in plat. I got placed in diamond 1 on the 6v6 placements and immediately stopped playing as I knew I was going to derank at a record-winning speed. I don't mind that I'm not ranking up. 

But when I get 9 wins in a row IMMEDIATELY followed by 12 losses in a row, all the joy of the game is sucked out for me. It feels like all my games are either my team stomping the enemy team or my team getting stomped. There have been too many gams where theres a dps/tank getting almost no (or sometimes actually getting 0 kills), or a support player just dpsing with 1k healing after 10 min. 

I don't know if its because of the way the game works or if its people smurfing/getting boosted/getting lucky in placements or just a skill-issue on my part, but getting stomped/stomping is not fun. The games that are actually close, where you can't tell within 1 minute that you're going to lose or win are the games that are enjoyable to play, even if you end up losing.

2025-04-09 16:19:12,761 - INFO - Content: "Main" and "Off" Tanks, a relic from the past?
Recently I saw some discussion around the format and the aspect of the quality of "Main" tanking as opposed to "Off" tanking caught my 
 
From what I've read, people express their discontent of having to play main tank, because they have to do the same thing they did before, just with less hp, boop resistance, passives and shitty armor. 
All while the "Off" tank is chilling on an angle denying value from flankers. 

Is this truly a format issue? 

6v6 is being reintroduced with all the changes to balance and system in the game, especially the new characters from OW2.

Now I ask, are the terms "Main" and "Off" tank still applicable, relevant or even restricting in the new state of the game?
How do Junkerqueen, Mauga, Tankfist or Hazard fit in?
Is tank synergy really that important or should you pick depending on map/overall team comp?
Lmk your thoughts.
