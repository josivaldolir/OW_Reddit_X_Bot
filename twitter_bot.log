2025-04-08 08:20:40,593 - INFO - Content: Now that the season is two weeks from finishing what is everyone’s final opinion on the return of lootboxes?
Picture attached is how many lootboxes I have earned up til this point (minus one.. don’t ask) 

Over 100 lootboxes before the end of the season is insanely generous. With pity system and 3 guaranteed legendaries I have been able to confirm at minimum 8 legendary skins from lootboxes alone. Maybe more if I get lucky.

I know next season won’t be as “charitable” but damn I hope they let us have at least 50 lootboxes per season with maybe 10 lootboxes being earnable through other methods.

(I'm new to Reddit, so the image didn't show up properly—reuploading it here!)  
  
Hi everyone! I'm a Korean Overwatch player.  
I came back for Season 15, and to celebrate the LE SSERAFIM collab, I made a pixel art version in the style of MapleStory, one of my favorite games! >w<  
(Hopefully I can do something for a second collab someday too!)  
Hope you all enjoy it! That’s all from me—bye\~ :)

Why this Juno skin is so detailed. If you look closer there are muscle on her shoulders and her armplts is so detailed and don't forget the hips line too. Like what the hell if you compare this skin to other Le Serafim skins the other skins are just bland compare to the Juno skin if they just add abs this skin will be perfect I will buy this skin 2x the price. Look for Soul Fighter Samira in L3ague her splash art has abs on it and it's so good.

Of all the skins I've purchased in other games like L3ague, Warz0ne, Rlvals, This specific Juno skins is the one I've felt happy that I bought this skin unlike the skins I bought in other games like, Yeah I bought it because I don't have a skin on this hero or it's just look cool. But this one is different and this will be my top personal favorite skin of all the games I've played.

i love magical girl anime’s and have wanted themed skins around that for ages. i was so excited when my prayers were answered and  dokiwatch was announced. The artowork for the skins came out and i fell in love. if we didn’t get a magical girl season, i think a mermaid/aquatic theme could have been cool.

Just died as an Ana to a Mei who cryo-froze on top, while I dropped to below. I was still slowed down even though I had no LOS to Mei. I thought it works similar to the ult, where walls block LOS. Am I mistaken, or is this a bug?

2025-04-09 01:09:25,728 - INFO - Content: Blizzard is killing it
Blizzard just released a patch for a 2-week event. That's insane. Do you remember when we would get one mid season patch and maybe a hot fix each season? This is an incredible turnaround and it's awesome to see them listening to the community and responding so quickly.

I didn't even expect wrecking ball to return to normalwatch after the invincibility bug yet they had fixed that in around 24 hours!!!

Yes, it's not a perfect game, but it's our imperfect game. Thank you blizzard for the lootboxes, the countless free legendary skins through events/twitch drops/discord quests, thank you for making a game where me and my friends can have fun together from 1000 miles apart.

Yea, let's lose this one. I don't care anymore. If you're gonna be a garbage instalock DPS, you can have fun like that then. Enjoy not having a tank. Or a second healer. I'm so over these people lol.

I thought having another tank would alleviate the stress of being the "foundation" of your team. And that is true, but you just feel sooo weak. 

I like being the raid boss. I like charging in and not immediately exploding. Your mere presence is impactful in 5v5. And if you don't want the stress? Just queue dps or support. I think its fine there is a role that is significantly more important, you dont have to play it!

I started playing with overwatch 2, so I’ve always played 5v5. I was trying to like 6v6 since it dropped, but I’m having the worst experience, most of the games no one picks support so im the only support player trying to keep 5 ppl alive, other games no one picks tank, and there are games where we have 4 support. I’ve rarely played a 2-2-2. I try to speak to my teammates in chat but they don’t listen. Gold rank BTW, what should i do?

2025-04-09 15:42:32,294 - INFO - Content: The matchmaking is ruining the game for me
I want to start off by saying I'm a plat player, and I 100% deserve to be in plat. I got placed in diamond 1 on the 6v6 placements and immediately stopped playing as I knew I was going to derank at a record-winning speed. I don't mind that I'm not ranking up. 

But when I get 9 wins in a row IMMEDIATELY followed by 12 losses in a row, all the joy of the game is sucked out for me. It feels like all my games are either my team stomping the enemy team or my team getting stomped. There have been too many gams where theres a dps/tank getting almost no (or sometimes actually getting 0 kills), or a support player just dpsing with 1k healing after 10 min. 

I don't know if its because of the way the game works or if its people smurfing/getting boosted/getting lucky in placements or just a skill-issue on my part, but getting stomped/stomping is not fun. The games that are actually close, where you can't tell within 1 minute that you're going to lose or win are the games that are enjoyable to play, even if you end up losing.

2025-04-09 16:19:12,761 - INFO - Content: "Main" and "Off" Tanks, a relic from the past?
Recently I saw some discussion around the format and the aspect of the quality of "Main" tanking as opposed to "Off" tanking caught my 
 
From what I've read, people express their discontent of having to play main tank, because they have to do the same thing they did before, just with less hp, boop resistance, passives and shitty armor. 
All while the "Off" tank is chilling on an angle denying value from flankers. 

Is this truly a format issue? 

6v6 is being reintroduced with all the changes to balance and system in the game, especially the new characters from OW2.

Now I ask, are the terms "Main" and "Off" tank still applicable, relevant or even restricting in the new state of the game?
How do Junkerqueen, Mauga, Tankfist or Hazard fit in?
Is tank synergy really that important or should you pick depending on map/overall team comp?
Lmk your thoughts.

I hope you like it because I love to design clothes so I had a lot of fun doing this. Sorry if the silhouette doesn't exactly match, I mostly did it just for fun not for functionality. 

You can see more overwatch canary on my Instagram and reddit profiles. Thank you.

2025-04-09 21:12:21,230 - INFO - Content: Support on Support crime is so funny to me.
I was playing control in 6v6 competitive and halfway through the first point, our Mercy was just being toxic in match chat. Of course, they’re the only one not in VC and our Kiriko was getting frustrated with them typing all game because she couldn’t keep us alive solo. 

We commented on how much they’re typing and our Kiriko said in VC “I could type more if I had 9 of my fingers free while playing my character”

I just couldn’t stop laughing at this interaction. We just reported our mercy and moved on, but support on support beef is just funny af.

After 2k hours in this game I can’t seem to win any of my games… I’ve never had this many losses. I’m not even mad or raging but 2 months of losing 90% of my matches has been miserable. My rank hasn’t changed and I’ve tried every role, and every mode and it’s always the same week after week to where I’m not even playing anymore. Am I alone in this or is everyone else also getting incredibly one sided matches?

Suddenly people are having trouble connecting and even getting penalized for it.  I'm afraid to even reconnect after the suspension since it may happen again and give me and even longer one.

My endorsement level already went down too which is a shame.

2025-04-10 01:09:07,007 - INFO - Content: With it having been over a month since they were released, how do you feel about perks and their implementation?
Personally, I've really enjoyed the extra nuance that choosing your perks brings, as well as the incentive they give you to stay on one character and not counterswap.

I will say, however, that my enjoyment of the former hinges on both perk options being equal, and in cases where one perk is significantly better than the other, it feels like the perk system falters.

What do you think?

So, this is from the Samoa map. I don't know if it's always been there, I only noticed it after the reveal for Aqua. Do y'all think maybe this is from him? He seemed like some kind of water bender so it'd be cool for him to be from a tropical region like Samoa even if he isn't directly Samoan.

Does anyone else also get this? I've heard from others that it was supposed to be fixed.

As someone who frequently uses the replay viewer, it is very frustrating that whenever I use time step or skip in the timeline, there is a very high chance of the game to either black screen, or log me out.

Does anyone know anything about this? ill be posting on forums as well to see what I can learn.

I got too impatient for next season! I needed her now lol. 

Right now, she's unfinished since I'm unable to see the backside enough to make the backpack and what not, but I was too excited to not share a progression picture!

She's made through mostly crochet, with a small bit of needle felting for details. The arms and sharks are both movable, to allow for some posing. 

Hope you guys enjoyed!

Have a wonderful day!

Hog, Junkrat, Moira, Widow, and Sombra are the only characters I know of who have clown skins, but I want them to go all out with the clowns. Someone made a skin concept for ball and it's fucking awesome.

I’ve been stuck plat 1 support for a year. Three days ago I hit diamond 5 - which I sometimes do before going on a losing streak but *this* time I climbed from plat 1 to diamond 2. I’ve gone from playing with golds and plats to masters in three days and it’s like a psychological horror. They are ACTUALLY thinking and I’m like Patrick from spongebob in comparison. And the amount of blame I get now.. *starts crying and shaking* 

There’s no point to this post, I’m just confused and awaiting the biggest losing streak to ever hit me, wish me luck :’)

2025-04-10 23:37:08,151 - INFO - Content: Why do I feel an immediate and deep sense of camaraderie with other Reinhardt players?
I've recently discovered a love for playing Rein.  And I don't know why, but anytime I see a Rein on the enemy team I feel really warmly towards them. I write 'Love you Rein' in chat, wave hello to them constantly, and if I'm doing much better than the other Rein I'll message the other team stuff like 'You be nice to your tank!' And of course I always, ALWAYS want to 1v1 the enemy Rein. 

Why does Reinhardt bring this out of me when playing against others who are running the same character as me don't?

2025-04-11 08:20:58,607 - INFO - Content: Are other Mercy players going through this?
Bit of a rant, sorry for that.
I've been having a pretty miserable time playing Mercy lately and I'm not talking about her gameplay. For context, I'm a pretty casual player and I stick to quickplay only.

I know she isn't the best hero meta wise right now, but I find her fun and I'm decent at her. I play her how she is intended. Nothing crazy, nothing terrible, I support my teammates and do my best not to die. But every single game, and I mean almost *every game*, I run into toxic player after toxic player on my team or the enemy team specifically targeting me.

Tanks getting mad at me for stuff very out of my control, spam asking for healing and dps getting mad at me if I don't pocket one of them enough, mean comments, general weirdness, you name it. I like keeping chat on because I'm nosy, but its been so constant that I decided to turn it off permanently. I can take criticism, but again, none of my mistakes warrant backlash of this intensity most of the time and I feel like any mistake (especially in quickplay) doesn't warrant any toxicity.

For the enemy team, yes, I'm aware that targeting supports is crucial to winning, that isn't what I am talking about here. I've been running into far more spawn campers lately than I ever have playing ow2, along with a lot more t-bagging despite me making sure I have never done anything to warrant it.

I ran into the same enemy venture two games in a row who made it their mission to use every toxic behavior you can imagine and there wasn't much I could do, even after swapping heroes. I can ignore toxicity just fine since its an inevitability playing these games for the record, but again its been so unbelievably rampant for me I am definitely taking a break from the game until things have hopefully chilled out. Made me wonder if anyone else is going through this, I dunno. I don't expect anyone to be friendly with me for playing Mercy or anything, and I don't expect a game to have zero toxicity, but I will say I've seen Mercy players get this treatment far more than any other mains, and it doesn't make sense to me.

Let me know what you think or share your experiences so I don't feel like I'm going crazy.

TL;DR: Been getting awful treatment by either team every game for the past week or two. I'm attributing it to me playing Mercy because that's usually how these things go, but it could just be an overwatch thing, quickplay thing, or both I dunno.

Not much context is needed. I prefer holding damage boost on an anti-naded target I intend on healing once the debuff expires. This Bastion didn't realize they had the anti-nade debuff and made this comment I find funny. I checked in the replay, there wasn't a single frame where I could have healed Bastion before they were eliminated.

2025-04-11 18:21:32,939 - INFO - Content: I climbed from Bronze to mid-Diamond over several years, this is what i noticed for EACH rank:
* Bronze: Poor grasp of the each CD and just a bad awareness overall.
* Silver: Basic CD usage and poor aim.  Lots of tug-o-war fights at chokepoints with little to no flanking.  Most of the outcomes only happen with ultimates.
* Gold: Mid-gold is pretty amateurish since they don't spend their CDs at every CD or just don't shoot enough.  Also they still don't actually secure elim purposefully.  Just low impact overall.  Still do dumb things like die because you didn't fall back 5 seconds earlier.  They still can't think 5 seconds ahead when your whole team's dead and the train is coming for you.
* Plat: Mid-plat is where you FINALLY see people doing heroes' intended combo kills consistently.  Blink and you're dead by the Genji's dash/righclick/melee in a flash.   Or how about ana going shoot + nade + shoot + melee.  mid-Plat ball gets scary since they will crush/boop/8headshots/melee you under 2 seconds.
* Diamond: For me, it's pretty scary.  Hyper-awareness in positioning and game sense.  This is where you see your own Mercy intentionally body-soak damages in front of you so you barely get to live.  If 76 or High Noon ult happens, everyone goes crazy to kill you, not hide.  You realize... It was all about high ground / corners / positioning all along.  I've died as well as killed because I was or enemy was literally 5 steps out of position for 2 seconds.

I might add.... people still don't group up consistently even at mid-Diamond LOL.  So many awkward walks as a tank because the Moira wanted to dive solo and die for some reason.

They had already announced it would happen april 15-21 on a previous blue post but now it seems they pushed it back 3 days. Last drive lasted 6 days but if this one is starting on a friday we might be looking at a weekend drive again like the first one. Not cool

I've seen plenty of people say this, and you're right. The robust ping system is wholly inadequate to communicate game-critical information like "fall back" and "attack the objective". 

It's important to keep chat enabled to get the true, holistic experience of playing with a nonstop barrage of deranged sociopaths providing valuable insight like "XYZ throwing" -- without, mind you, understanding that "throwing" is not the same thing as "being bad", but nobody playing this game seems to know that -- and cutting-edge analysis like "<role> diff" that really makes the game a pleasure to play.

2025-04-12 18:42:55,749 - INFO - Content: Diablo skins should be in Loot Boxes because it was not a collab
Why it was not a collab:

1. All the official collabs are Overwatch x Collab, for example Overwatch x World of Warcraft. The Rise of Darkness was the name of the event.
2. The skins were scattered all over the place. Azmodan Hammond for free, 2 skins in the Ultimate BP, skins in BP, etc. All the official colabs had skins only in shop.
3. The most important, the Diablo skins are available in Maximilien's Vault. If Diablo event was a collab, why we don't have skins from Transformers of World or Warcraft in Maximilien's Vault?!

Hey! So I made this version to match the aesthetic of Happy Nation and further add some details here and there. This is what I’d consider my true vision for the book’s look. I’m gonna place the full comic in the comments below, as the last four pages couldn’t fit in the entire post.

Besides getting everything for free, what would you like to see for the future of Overwatch? It could be reasonable things or completely unrealistic. After the rollout of changes such as perks and playing the April Fool’s Normalwatch mode, I was thinking about all the fun things Blizzard could explore. 

Examples:

-Queue for specific maps/modes

-More in-game character interaction such as Lifeweaver’s pull or Hanzo riding Orisa

-Keep bringing the winnable loot boxes!

Eichenwalde: After you capture the first point on offense, and begin to push the cart, I wish there was another entry to the other side of the wall that defense is on. Your options are, effectively, main gate that gets pushed open, the exits right past them (two exits), or the small corridor right before them (two exits; one primarily going through the upstairs cabin). Ultimately, though, the result is the same - you come to the other side - five dif't options - and yet they're all within a few feet, on the same level, having to face, effectively, the same direction - however, the enemy (defense) has a wide variety of heights to be standing from, or cubbies/walls to be hiding behind. 

Some characters can jump above the dilapidated wall and find themselves on the other side with some height, but it's limited to characters with great jump/boost or some type of flight. 

This bothers me for two reasons. 1) In hundreds of games on this map, this is always the sticking point where it becomes boring. First point also has a choke point, but it's early game and there's always friction early... and late game starts opening up. But I feel like if teams are evenly matched, it's just five minutes of standing around the broken gate or just past it. When defense wins, it always seems to be here (in my games, at least). 2) If offense is successful, the run from spawn to the next point is long and boring... it's so. much. downtime. 

I have a few quibbles with every map, but I totally "Get it" and I can accept, typically, it's more a "me" problem. But in my small circle of IRL friends that I play with, we all tend to agree that this map's pacing is boring mid-game and a small adjustment to first capture point spawn and options to make forward momentum would be a huge improvement. Just knocking down the dilapidated wall and letting any character take this path would be a small, but possibly effective change.

2025-04-13 19:36:11,219 - INFO - Content: I miss Freja.
I don't think I've ever vibed with a character as much as I do with Freja. I've been a big Ashe and Cass player for awhile now, but Freja just scratches some itch that those characters don't.

Take Aim is a literal firework of dopamine every damn time I score a critical hit with it. Something about jumping into the air, dashing into the enemy sightlines, popping some support in the skull, dashing back into cover and seeing the elimination icon seconds later gives this "You are already dead" type of feeling. It's so fun. It's literally so fun that she gets this Widowmaker syndrome of never using her primary fire, since her secondary is just beyond satisfying. Not to mention how good Take Aim is at removing armour, making her a solid pick for countering certain tanks if you can get the dash down.

I think one of my favourite parts about her is that she's a glass cannon. She does an intense amount of dps in the right hands, but her "float in the air when ADS" ability makes it so that any good hitscan hero and snipe her fairly quickly while she's airborne. She rewards new players with a lot of dps, but will just as quickly punish them if they don't grasp her weaknesses. 

Usually when a new OW character comes out, I have this period of thinking "Yeah! This'll be \*my\* hero", before finding out their weakpoints and going back to my comfort picks. But Freja is different. I think I've played a single match of Overwatch since Freja's playtest ended, and I really don't want to go back until she gets here. High mobility, high skill ceiling, rewarding gameplay, well-balanced (In my eyes, at least) and solid perks. What's not to like?

I'm counting down the days until Freja gets released, and I can't wait to hop back into my future main.

I've said this a couple of times throughout my matches: Support is very unfun to play this April fools patch

Then people say that it's just me and that I'm just not a support main (which I am) so I wouldn't understand.

But then in all of my matches, no one is playing support. It's all dooms and balls and sombras etc etc with the rare exception of a mercy blasting away 

If support is so fun, why isn't anyone playing it?

2025-04-13 21:13:33,830 - INFO - Content: Cheating, or just crazy settings?
So I came across this Soldier last night, and the kill cam seemed really weird. They started off as widow, but then after they first died they switched to soldier. I went back and watched the replay, watched him for basically the entire game, and it just seems weeeird.

I also think the Moira on the same team might be their duo because we had played against both of them just the previous match. Could be coincidence, but their kill cam looked weird too, but not as bad as the soldier.

For context: I’m the sombra on the blue team. I know I’m probably not great, but it was just quickplay and I was just having a good time with my friends when I noticed the weird choppy stuff.

I know that sometimes having just the right settings can make it seem off, so I wanted to get some more opinions before I wrongfully reported anything.

2025-04-13 21:35:58,561 - INFO - Content: Is D.Va actually a counter to Zarya if played right?
So yeah, everyone says Zarya destroys D.Va. And sure, in a straight 1v1, she kinda does. Beams go through matrix, bubbles punish D.Va for diving in, all that.

But in actual games, I feel like D.Va can play around Zarya pretty well. She’s way more mobile, can ignore her and go straight for the backline, force cooldowns, then rotate out before Zarya even gets there.

Zarya’s great at punishing mistakes, but she’s slow. If D.Va plays smart, pokes a bit, waits out bubbles, then goes in with her team — isn’t she actually the one putting Zarya on the back foot?

Curious what people think. Am I onto something or just full of copium?

Like, just honestly. I started playing this game two weeks ago so I could play with some friends. I have a great time playing with them and we usually have a full squad. I'm still learning the game but I feel I'm getting a lot better. but.

Whenever I play solo, if I have a bad game, I swear, people in the text chat legit start calling me crap etc. One person told me to stop playing entirely in quick play. I didn't even have that bad of a game. I honestly don't get it lol. I mean my friend, she's really really good, she thinks I'm playing well, and honestly that's all I care about. but geez some people.

Like sure it was cool spamming stomps as Baptiste at first, but it got tiring real once I found the only others healers I play were either converted to a DPS (Moira), have become non-deterministic (Kiriko), or just shoot faster (Zen).

If I DON'T play support we always get put in a match against people who do and get stomped.

I Can't for the life of me remember what streamer I heard say it but It never left my brain. If you could equip souvenirs as a death token so when someone kills you,they just flop on the floor.
The " Here lies Jack Morrison,Grave" would be so funny to see fall out on killing 76 for example. They wouldn't take up and Emote spot, it give a little more whimsy to the game and alot of those weird Souvenirs could actually be used. Another Example: You kill Winston and Winton falls out. I just think it make them more desirable to get then they are now.

2025-04-14 11:36:09,686 - INFO - Content: First hero to get a Play of the Game?
Just scrolling the Overwatch subreddit and I started to reminisce about when I first started playing the game.

My very first Play of the Game was with Junkrat. I remember watching some Junkrat player on YouTube and he would stall his tire on a corner and the last 3 seconds go in for the kill.

So I tried it on Hanamura. I was on the balcony where the Dragons short with Genji and Hanzo happened. Popped the ult and stuck it on the wall until it was about to expire. Then I just rolled in the door to the point and took out the enemy team. 

So what was your first hero to get Play of the game?

2025-04-14 22:14:31,046 - INFO - Content: It’s going to feel really bad come next season to only get 3 lootboxes per week.
Especially considering how many recolours and filler skins there are, even the 13 per week we had this season doesn’t feel like enough to get what you want. Once next season rolls around I hope there’s a middle ground we can reach long term for how many boxes can be earned by playing outside of specific events. I’m thinking personally that 6 boxes which would be 2 per weekly game milestone so we don’t need to artificially inflate the games required would hopefully be a good middle ground that will feel much better and still retain a sense of progression or reward compared to only having access to 3.

Not only are we getting a really in-depth mode with Stadium but we're also getting Freja, hero bans and Doki-skins (if you care about that :D).

We really never have gotten this much stuff during a random season in OW1. I'm so glad with the current state of OW2 and it's pretty crazy this game is 9 years old and yet they're always finding ways to keeping it fresh. Can't wait for next week!

Credit to u/SpiderPanther01 for the second image. 

  
Streamers are playing Early Access right now and XLV's weapon was seen in one of the spawn areas. This angle kinda makes it look like it has two blades?

  
Also appears to have a wolf emblem on it, which would fit with the second image saying "LA LUPA"

  
"La lupa" means "The She-Wolf" and is likely a reference to the wolf that nursed Romulus and Remus, Romulus being the traditional founder and first king of Rome.

I’ve been wondering who else, if anyone, might get a Dokiwatch skin. I’d estimate around 7-8 characters in total will get one themed around Dokiwatch while other skins will be differently themed as they’ve done for previous seasons themes.

It just occurred to me today that every character so far has a different colour (Juno obviously has multiple options but her base one is pink)

So Kiriko is purple, Freja is teal, Brigitte is orange, Juno is pink and Widow is dark blue.

This kinda makes me think Mei/ Mercy are unlikely cos they’re more associated with blues/yellows which are already close to colours taken. Mei could get a red magical girl skin but I see that making more sense for Sojourn or even JQ.

Alternatively something like a Bishonen magical prince style Lifeweaver (surely they wouldn’t do a straight up tuxedo mask rip off) or even an anime villain style fit for Sigma.

Has anyone got any other ideas?

Pinged our dead Pharah to say that I can’t rez them, then this showed up. Usually it bugs out and shows me “(  s)” but this is a new one. I did have a Reinhardt on the team but he wasn’t nearby. 

I asked and a teammate said they saw it as “17 s” not “Reinhardt s” lol

This season was so goated and will probably be my most memorable moving forward, I had tons of fun. 

Perks were really fun and thankfully didnt cause any mahor issues so far. I still fear they might become problematic in the future but for this season alone it was really fun exploring new stuff.

Loot boxes were goated, really fun addition

Comp was pretty good overall, orisa was mid and mauga was trash, so way better experience for tanks, zarya is a problem but she hadnt gotten the spotlight so I assume she'll get more nerfed soon. Sojourn is the spawn of Satan but hero bans will take care of the issue so its fine.

6v6 and April fools mode were incredible, I really liked the variety of rosters you could pick in open queue. And normalwatch was just hilarious. 

So many things to do and lots of fun new features and mode and not that much out of the ordinary to be mad about, so I applaud the team for their efforts especially during a time where there's tough competition. Definitely one of the most goated seasons.

I think its a good time to be playing overwatch as opposed to a few months ago.

2025-04-15 15:15:29,531 - INFO - Content: Overwatch Devs have been cooking recently
Let's be honest, OW2's development history has been... troubled. When PVE was cancelled we all thought it was the end. Now, come season 15, Overwatch has turned the corner and the future is looking super bright.

Perks - Obviously this was, no pun intended, a game changer. Perks have kept me and many others hooked for much longer than I thought, they completely change the approach to games whilst still keeping that core experience. Whoever came up with the idea deserves a raise.

New heroes - Hazard in particular was a big success and proved that the devs CAN continue to make fun, balanced tanks in 5v5. Freja looks to be nothing groundbreaking but still fun with a good design. Changes to Lifeweaver and Mauga have also been really good and made them a lot less frustrating.

Stadium - I thought stadium was going to be a gimmicky side show to the main modes of OW. Seeing that trailer made me realise just how fleshed out it is! A tournament like mode with skill trees, ranks, unique abilities, etc sounds incredibly fun and I can't wait til it releases in a week! 

6v6 - A big issue for a long time. Extending the 6v6 Open Queue to all of next season is perfect, think it should remain permanent. People now have a choice of 5v5 or 6v6 depending on their preference, I think that's fantastic!

Loot boxes - A fantastic and consumer friendly way to keep people playing. It's a shame they'll be reducing the amount, hopefully not by the number being rumoured, but getting anything for free is still nice!

Balance - Say what you will about balance (I know I have my opinions *cough cough why is Sojourn STILL hard meta*) but at the very least they are willing to do hot fix patches on a whim, even for the april fools event! I think that element can be praised whilst still having reservations about some other decisions.

All in all I think it goes without saying that the devs have really been hitting it out of the park recently. People calling them "lazy" is just plain wrong. There are OF COURSE still issues with OW, and there always will be, but the decisions of Aaron and the team have lead the game to a healthy state of growth and competition. I think that deserves praise.

I wanted to change the look of my weapons with Reinhardt so I could see the different weapon skins, but I hate not being able to do my weapon flourish. They should create basic weapon flourishes for all weapons, and the mythic ones could be available to select. That way, those who have mythic skins could equip the flourishes for all weapons since they’d be unlocking a new one.

2025-04-16 01:11:07,146 - INFO - Content: Apparently QP "isn't an excuse" to go a hero you don't normally play
I hardly play Doom but thought it would be funny to try a round in QP.

I warned my team saying "I don't play Doom really just to warn"

My Ana said "Then don't play him"

I said it was QP so I'm just gonna play Doom

Then my Ana said she wasn't going to heal me (she didn't and ended the game with 56 heals) my Kiriko said "thats not an excuse but ok" and I got this when we lost.

Obviously its not too bad, it's just QP, but this is what I mean about people taking QP too seriously. Where the hell else am I suppose to learn new characters?

i spent some time grinding the normalwatch mode, apparently i impressed some guy with my mercy skills (i’m not good but i know how to superjump) and now he won’t stop messaging me on the psn app 😭

he’s a sweet enough guy, i admit i humoured him at first but it’s genuinely too much. he keeps calling me “his mercy” and even said he loved me? i will feel bad removing him but i don’t think there’s much else i can do?

sorry if he somehow comes across this

Ever since the switch to the OW2 engine Numbani specifically has been a pain to play on because every time I have to look up half my screen gets flashbanged because of the sun. This happens on other maps as well but this is the worst one because of the elevations.  
  
I don't know if its my settings and its making me go crazy. I've been messing with my settings trying to change this forever. Can I fix this? Am I the only one with this problem?

2025-04-17 02:48:05,736 - INFO - Content: Why do people wait until literally the end of the game to switch?
I'm genuinely curious as to why. Here's the scenario, we'll use 6v6 because this is an open queue issue: it doesn't matter if it's QP or comp open queue, people will select 2 tanks, you select support, and the other 3 pick dps and then the support is hard struggling to keep everybody alive. One of the dps' should swap to support to help right? Anyway, no one swaps to help the clearly struggling support until literally the end of the game when it's about to be defeat and the only support got tired of people spamming I need healing so said fuck it and went dps as well (it's me, I'm the support in question) because we're losing anyway and I can't keep everyone always in critical alive by myself so I just swap off since no one seems to see I need help and refuse to help me out.

But it seems to happen a LOT. Even when open queue was 5v5, Quick play or comp, people will refuse to swap to what's clearly needed or will help the team struggling. Even more baffling is when the dps' that refuse to swap are going negative but then they make the swaps that needed to be made 2 rounds ago *at the very end of the game*. WHY? This drives me absolutely insane each time it happens. Why do you pick until the end of the game before making the swaps that could've helped us a lot sooner? I don't understand.

Lots to consider, but a Genji main may be trying to ban Moira, as en example. Or, a Pharah main might wanna ban hit scans 

So I was taking into account big counter heroes

Remember you’re not just voting out the enemy heroes but also your own team

Some players might not want a LW on their team

B and C I almost considered merging into one group

2025-04-18 04:43:22,580 - INFO - Content: Smurfs are ruining the game for everyone.
I’m sure most of the people here are gonna be mad but it’s true. You can call it an “alt account” all you want but you’re just a smurf.

It ruins the game for all the other people that are playing against you. If someone is gold but they’re playing against someone that SHOULD BE in high diamond, there is nothing they can do. It isn’t fun. I don’t understand how it’s fun for you, as the Smurf, to play against people that have a much lower skill than you. Obviously you’re gonna win but doesn’t that win feel empty? Like, “yay! I won!…… but I won against people that are way below my rank…..” 

As my brother likes to say, little league isn’t fun when you’re playing against adults. And it’s embarrassing for an adult to be playing against little kids. 

You maybe need to step back for a second, talk to a therapist, and figure out why you feel the need to get validation in this way. Because it’s a false validation. It truly means nothing. If I gave you a math test with questions like 2+2 and 5-1, you would ace the test, but would you feel smart? 

I know what you’re gonna say, “I only have my alt account so I can play with my friends!” No. If it was TRULY about playing the game with your friends, you would play quick play. And you SHOULD play quick play instead of ruining everyone’s ranks. Because you are ruining everyone else’s rank. If you’re playing in a lower rank lobby but you should be in a much higher one, obviously the people that aren’t cheating are going to lose and they will derank. Which isn’t fair to them because they never even had a shot. So because of people like you, other people are in ranks that they don’t belong in. Because YOU are in a rank that you don’t belong in. I get secondhand embarrassment when I see people smurfing like that. Are you really that desperate for any kind of ego boost that you only play against people you know you’ll win against? And even worse, the times that the other team actually pulls through and you lose? Against people multiple ranks below you?? Aren’t you sad and embarrassed??! 

My team played against three Smurfs on a team today. Their accounts were only 40 hours old but they played in multiple competitive seasons. Last season, they started in diamond, deranked to bronze, and are currently plat. And of course they were talking all kinds of crap and saying “ezzzz”. But of course it was easy. They shouldn’t have been in that match. They should be in diamond or master where they belong. 

So stop ruining the game for everyone else. Do some self reflection and play in the rank you belong in. Everyone would have more fun. Even you! Losing sucks but it doesn’t feel as bad when it’s an even-ish match. 

And for those of you that read this and have your fingers poised and ready to say “you just suck!”… you can stop right now. Because all that does is show everyone else that you are one of those people that deranks so you can finally win. And when you think about it that way… one of us definitely sucks.. and I don’t think it’s me.  ;) 

Anyway, good luck on the drives this weekend. Hopefully we can all get the rewards despite these cheaters. Glhf! <3

I would say it is the ferret because that's the animal she is with on her Dokiwatch skin 

Most of the Dokiwatch skin have a animal that the character likes 

Brigitte - Cat 

Widowmaker - Spider 

Kiriko - Fox 

So Freja's favourite animal got to be a Ferret and the fact that Ferrets are hunters on the wild 

What do you think? I was expecting to be a Owl because they're excellent hunters.

Honestly, the aesthetic that most skins have been (Magical/Fantasy) is just not appealing to me, my favorite aesthetic is the Talon, Null-Sector & Overwatch styles (basically anything lore based). 

PS: I'm still waiting for the Talon Heavy Mauga skin.

The point (on Blizzard's side) of drives is to get more players into Comp, right? It feels like it's current state will only push players away. As it stands, it's a miserable experience. Largely due to matchmaking being awful. If you don't want to fix matchmaking, then at least let us earn rewards without losing points. Double the amount or whatever. I'm fine with that.

2025-04-20 05:40:01,391 - INFO - Content: Heading into Season 16 with XIM left unchecked - Lengthy, informative, non-rant post for devs, tech experts and players.
**(Replay code is provided at the end)**

Moderators, I read through your rules regarding this topic and that's why I want to be as thorough and adhering as possible.

Devs, this post is purely created with the intention for you to investigate how and when this hardware is currently used (you are already aware, what it is used for as per your Spotlight Q&As). These players have been reported by everyone in my team without even asking them to, **they already knew from the start**.

**TLDR**; Comprehensive explanation to how Ximmers navigate comp. A problem invalidated too much during S15 that should be spoken about more **calmly and clearly** instead of angrily. Slight amount of personal experiences to better define the shape of the problem. Some ideas for solutions are shared. Location: EU. My replay code is just an example of MANY matches I and many others have had to deal with.

# 1. Introduction

I've wanted to make this post for a really long time, since about 20-25 days into S15, but I always held hope that things would resolve. I've seen so many posts from Platinum and Diamond players completely invalidated by higher rank users when they try to explain there's a new Xim epidemic. I hope for those players this post can be a bit of relief that you're not alone.

Below you will find two videos attached, each showing the perspective of Xim users on the Platinum, Diamond and Masters range (**synchronously**). For people who aren't aware of it, this is how it looks.

[Ashe on XIM - lvl 1 endorsement, fresh Xbox account matching with other duo](https://reddit.com/link/1k3crc7/video/t862zvtd1wve1/player)

Might be jittery thumbs, new player who's just really good. Let's look further:

[I've censored half of the gamertag to prevent witchhunting. These short acronyms for \\"xim\\", specifically this one, there are hundreds of them for different games, a lot of them for Overwatch as this is NOT the first time seeing it written in such a way.](https://preview.redd.it/ahl76myn1wve1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=9318528628ec952eb1043f271026bbc98701cac6)

# 2. Why have I used the word 'epidemic'?

Since **right before the start of Season 15,** the increase of XIM users has been substantially visible. When Season 15 started, numerous rumors and posts have spread claiming that, as an emulator, XIM has managed to bypass current rules and can camouflage itself as a controller more than before. People report these findings through digging in their forums, finding that **a new patch went out** which is highly believable considering how different it feels **now**. There are people proudly posting XIM montages on popular platforms such as Instagram, Tiktok, Youtube, further incentivizing players who have **felt left out** (common phrase used: *"everyone is ximming, you might as well xim too"* or **cheated out of the system** buying this prohibited hardware. Remember my word usage: **Increase**.

# 3. How easily this can happen, and why ban waves aren't necessarily the answer:

First of all, I hope I don't sound rude by claiming your current measures aren't the answer, but I'd like to explain myself with what I mean by the heading. It's what I call "availability". Ximmers follow 3 very routine steps (which I won't go into detail to prevent this spread):

1. Account creation (estimated time required \~5 minutes if the account isn't bought, this includes email etc.)
2. (Not necessarily, but almost always the case) an Xbox LFG Post titled something like "50 QP wins quick", "need 50 qp wins will carry", "need **mercy** for 50qp wins". Of course, a lot of these posts can just be smurf accounts, however they purposefully place the tag "#xim", so...
3. Competitive access comes right after the player has reached placements.

**Let me be clear, ban waves are totally ineffective to cheaters who genuinely enjoy playing Overwatch.** They will NOT stop creating 5-minute alt accounts to Xim with, and that's without mentioning the hidden economical gains behind boosting. **Ban -> account creation. A ceaseless loop.**

How often does this happen? There's no objective data. From my personal experience, hardcore Xim users appear 6 to 14+ times a week. It also depends on if it's the same ximmers, because that does happen.

# 3.a. What happens during and after the placement matches (lengthy explanation of scenarios ahead):

**SPECIFIC TO PLATINUM - DIAMOND - MASTER (M5 - M3+) the matchmaking is COMPLETELY destroyed. The ximmers, at their own benefit, disrupt the match for everybody in multiple senses.**

*With the current knowledge that everybody in these ranks knows when somebody is ximming 20 seconds into a match);*

1. Team A (not a full stack) has a ximmer, they stop playing like they usually would and either let the ximmer do whatever they want for the win, or they try to disrupt the ximmer (far too rare). Team A's players, without the ximmer, will go into the next match ending with a loss due to a confused matchmaker, facing the ximmer they had on their team thereby wasting ∼40 minutes' worth of comp session, or (personal issue) overconfidence. This is almost a guarantee from the research I tried to conduct with people I asked.
2. Team A, game 2. A full stack with 1 (or more) ximmers who are boosting. This is an automatic loss for the non-ximmer team below Masters, but admittedly it does depend on if you're in a "mirrored" Masters lobby, just because the game sense is better and things like this are easier to coordinate. Of course this does not excuse the behavior at all, and it still likely causes a landslide disparity/loss.
3. What ximmers like to do: mass report if they lose, and it works! Yeah, for some reason this is really common, then they come back with fresh accounts and do it all over again. Your main gets suspended, and they pop out like whack-a-moles for several more rounds.

*Side tip: this wasn't about chatting, but it reminds me to say this: don't risk defending yourself in chat when a ximmer is being toxic to you, they will tell everyone to report you for anything under communication. Report them for harassing you and move on.*

4. Common knowledge, but like with smurf accounts, the matchmaker is tilted and confused with who to place where because of ximmers. **How often this happens seems to be making the problem far worse**.

Short anecdote: During my D4 matches, I had one where the enemy team was a full gold team with a ximmer who had the game sense of an M5. The ximmer went 33 - 5 and the rest of their team were all below 10 kills each, with multiple deaths and accounts showing gold gold gold. None of them seem to have had a grasp of what was happening. That team did not lose because ours was better, they lost because my whole team focused the solo ximmer who was **likely boosting that account they were playing on. The ximmer stopped trying on round 2 and stayed AFK, making the opposite team -1 DPS. The thing is, ximmers on alt accounts don't have to care, because it does not affect their main account.**

5. D4 to M5: **You will get ximmers or people boosted by Xim usage in your team who have absolutely no idea what they're doing.** This is especially frustrating when you watch post-match replays and they aren't even at Platinum level; it is blatantly obvious they didn't get there through sheer grind and it even seems that they're throwing on purpose at first. It is worse when you see they've been ximming and making you lose. These are losses nobody needs, losses we annoyingly get over when we say, "it happens".

This is what people are frustrated about when (on console) people ask, "has anyone else seen bots in Diamond or just me?". **Ximmers usually have aim and strafe that can't be matched, but they severely lack in game awareness and that is how real players are able to tell them apart.**

6. Mercy pockets Sojourn/Ashe/Soldier: you die in two seconds from any type of burst. This is the one everybody is familiar with and why console folks want to ban Mercy. While I have personal qualms against damage boost, this is **NOT** a Mercy issue.

This one is slightly harder to put into words, but you can tell when pocket hitscans are ximming or not. There is a certain feeling to it that assures you, and unless you get to see what their accounts look like, positioning needs to heavily be considered (5.).

7. Higher rank players need to **stop invalidating Platinum players**, because many of these Ximmers fall out of their placement ranks and get quickly calibrated as low as Platinum 5. Devs, if you're reading this, I hope you are aware of this too.

# 4. Through my own opinion, these are possible solutions I can think of (opinions on 3 are appreciated):

1. Many people will hate to see me type this, I know, but re-enabling phone verification for console like it is on PC might be the play that can help a lot. I personally think console players can't be trusted anymore, to be honest with you, most randoms I end up adding as friends already have a decorated BattleNet account anyways... This would also cut down smurfing by at least half, which, even if it isn't against TOS, majority of the playerbase would appreciate.
2. **Increasing the FOV**. While this seems like a technical issue currently, I think it would be beneficial to combat Ximmers. Xim users, unless they're on Genji, make themselves as untouchable as possible because they can't risk the so called "delay" they ""have"". They often put themselves in godspots and heavens, where nobody in their rank would play on for more than 1 minute at a time. These spots are often hard to see with the current low FOV, that's my point.
3. 50 QP wins aren't enough for a common player to understand Overwatch. I think this should be extended far more, maybe double. An original idea I had is something that would surely bother these cheaters the most: if they had to wait out a specific timer on the brand-new account, like "**competitive unlocks in 10-30 days**".

Doing something like this carries two benefits: an uptick of account creations for Overwatch which can be closely monitored and perhaps bracketed; players coming back to Overwatch or players excited for the new season are (for the most part) worry-free for at least 10-30 days.

4. **Break the sequence**. I've explained to you what the basic process for a ximmer looks like. There has to be a way to train Defense Matrix to see that: a new user doing 50 quickplay wins, also accompanied by a Mercy pocket with above average capabilities, heading right into comp once they're done and smashing through placements should be an immediate flag for the system.

5. IP bans. No explanation needed. People accused of cheating when they are on controller are completely fine (or so I hope), the game detects controllers, 0 aim smoothing etc. We in Diamond and (M5 for me) have all been reported for cheating one way or another and nothing happened because we're on controller. But a brand-new account that is detected by Defense Matrix and placed into "PC lobbies until they stop doing it" is not a solution, in fact it **makes the problem even worse.**

Now PC players have to deal with ximmers, who (I'm pretty sure) have had their aim assist revoked, so they get a cheater deadweight on their team. But not only that, **what's worse is that ximmers use this as a bell to alert them when their account is compromised.** That is their prime time for creating a new one and being stealthier about it (or not!). People detected of ximming 100% by the system need to be IP banned if they can't be hardware banned. Cheaters have no reason to be in a competitive FPS like Overwatch, or any other competitive FPS for that matter.

5. Conclusion

I will fully cooperate if more details are needed, and I don't claim to be an expert. I'm just another gamer who waited too long to post about it. I love Overwatch, especially now with these exciting seasons, but this is undeniably disgusting, and it has gotten out of hand. Like senior system designer Gavin Winter said, these cheaters are holding people with disabilities hostage by abusing third party accessories.

So what happens in the match that made me post this? Within 20 seconds my whole team knew there were ximmers, this was at like midnight, and we were all chillin. I was in a duo, the rest were randoms. The Winston was really good actually, but even he didn't care either. None of us did, so we messed around and did what we wanted, going for kills on whoever we saw. All of them were kind, we all endorsed each other and wished each other a goodnight. Classically the Dva on the opposite team says "gg" after the ximmers make their clips.

It is unknown who was being boosted, but we suspect the Ana was. Her profile showed gold-plat hardstuck and suddenly this season she's Masters with extremely slow reflexes. As someone who worked very hard to reach M5 last year, I would never place that Ana above P4.

If you made it this far, thank you so much for taking your time reading this!

Solo queueing when the drives are out is not for the faint-hearted, let me tell you. Teammates often go for three DPS, and I end up being the only support. Then they complain when they aren’t getting healed. The level of ego people have is insane, especially when they aren’t performing well, yet they still say “GG” and “EZ” even when they nearly lost.But now I can finally rest 😭

I think most of people didn't realize this until now, but Zen literally has no cooldown on his discord orb. I've been literally having a streak of 11 wins on quick play. He's very powerful, and yet I don't see him being meta. Is everyone sleeping on Zen? I think he will probably be meta when hero bans come out because we're going to be baning the most powerful heroes such as tanks instead of Zen.

Our Ana spent 80% of an 11 minute game with >200 heals... ON NEW JUNKERTOWN FLASHPOINT.

They got the first point, then we got two in a row, then they got third so we were 2/2, last point we win with them at 99%.

I was borderline shaking afterwards. I have never been so locked in on healing.
