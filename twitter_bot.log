2025-02-17 22:12:11,521 - INFO - Content: Stadium looks infinitely cooler than the canceled Hero Mode
Seriously, kudos to the devs for managing to salvage the talent system into something cool.

I know people were furious when hero mode was canceled, but I've always been extremely skeptical about how hero mode was going to stay fun. We already had a taste of what hero mode was going to be (sans talents) with the Underworld event and it was fucking boring as all hell. It was so boring that I will bet that 90% of those reading this probably does not even remember what it was. Adding a grindy treadmill in the form of WoW talents would not have fundamentally improved the experience.

I greatly prefer the way Stadium looks from the outset and I frankly find it far more fun to have a Heroes of the Storm style talent build that remains dynamic throughout the match than the static WoW style tree.

2025-02-18 06:18:49,309 - INFO - Content: Kiriko hate feels so... two-faced
First off, i'm a Lifeweaver main. But i can't help but feel kinda weird whenever i see the crazy amount of hate towards Kiriko.

The whole hate's "reason" is because she's getting many skins. Yes, i agree and i'm not big of a fan that every 6 heroes are getting skins each and every season. But god forbid when Kiriko gets another one.

Reinhardt received like almost all the collab skins, if not all. He receives skin after skin, mythic weapon, mythic skin etc.

Ana, Pharah, Mercy, Soldier, McCassidy received so many skins back to back. Mercy and Ana already received mythic skins. And now it's Juno's turn to receive so many skins back to back. What now? Is it "Hate the Juno" time?

I totally understand that you guys are upset that Kiriko is receiving so many skins. And "Kiriko treatment" is a real thing.

But "hate"? Some of you guys not just hate the character, but also direct your hate to the very player themself.

It just isn't fair or reasonable at all. Why other "always gets skin" heroes don't receive the same hate?

Stop the hate towards anyone!

Ow2 changed how you played ow and I wasn‚Äôt a huge fan, but the perks feel like they really add another layer to the game and makes the gameplay feel so refreshing. 

Let‚Äôs be honest the never ending buffs and nerfs were never going to fix the game and make it what it once was, and adding a whole new layer to it won‚Äôt make it what it once was, but it‚Äôs different and that is refreshing in its own right.


What‚Äôs everyone else think of it so far?

The lootboxes feels so right and the Pearks gives so much deapth to the game without feeling overpowered. I feel like overwatch was always about the heroes we played. The customization feels so right. The abilities makes sense im so happy about the Lifeweaver, Orisa, Reaper returned abilities its just makes sense.

42 characters. 

168 perks. 

And everything I‚Äôve tried so far has felt well-balanced and meaningful, nudging characters towards certain play styles without breaking the fundamentals. I‚Äôm sure in the weeks and months ahead, exploits will emerge, certain combinations will be considered O/UP, but to come out of the gate swinging like this is incredibly impressive. 

Bravo, team!

2025-02-19 22:13:20,993 - INFO - Content: Perks are great, but...
I made a similar post to this before I went to bed last night, I'm gonna try and stay more brief and hopefully a bit more eloquent this time around. Warning for intense yapping from this point forward.

**But first, a necessary TL;DR that present Epoch made to save you from past Epoch:**

- The current leveling system doesn't prevent counter swapping as intended. It also makes the perk system *worse* in many ways it wouldn't be otherwise (more chaotic, less fair, less time to enjoy the perks themselves)

- In the long term, I think perks would benefit from a different form of acquisition. I would prefer both minor and major perks to be unlocked from the beginning of a match, but other solutions could be better.

- Making perk-gaining more consistent would benefit both casual and high-level play, allowing people to play the same characters in different ways and showcasing more skill expression with the new abilities added by this mechanic.

**(ACTUAL YAP AND FURTHER DETAILING FROM THIS POINT FORWARD)**

The levelling system, in my opinion, massively undermines how effective and enjoyable perks are as a whole.

Conceptually, the main benefit of a levelling system is that it's a silent but deadly nerf to counter swapping, with people losing their levels, and therefore perks, when they switch characters.

As far as I can see, this intention is sorely ineffective, and punishes non-counterswappers more. As it stands, the levelling system really just serves as an incentive for the team who loses the first team fight to swap *immediately* to their chosen hard counters, as to not get too far behind, then attempt to snowball with the next team fight. Alternatively, attackers can just walk back into spawn before dying, and swap to the best hero for the job. The exact same way they could before. 

In the end, the only circumstances where this system is really detrimental to counterswapping is when a team decides *later* into a match that a particular enemy is a problem. This means that the levelling system's intentional purpose really only comes into play in matches that are very close, with both teams on more or less equal footing. This accounts for a *very* small amount of Overwatch games, as in most matches one team will very clearly gain the upper hand early on, either stomping or forcing the enemy to change strategies to change that.

So the levelling system fails at it's main purpose. This alone isn't so bad, but the consequence of *having* this levelling mechanic on top of the perk system as a whole makes the latter so much more chaotic, ineffective and boring than it should be. With most characters' game-changing perks locked behind level 3, many heroes cannot benefit from them until late into a round, leaving them with one, maybe two team fights left to get used out of them. 

This alone makes perks completely useless in curbing hard counters. At level 3, Junkrat could choose more range to deal with poke heroes and longer sight lines, but to get to this point he must first run his base kit into these problem matchups for several minutes, trying to do enough damage to get there.

On the flip side, there's Orisa. With one of her major perks swapping her javelin spin for her old barrier, there comes a time in every round where your team might just suddenly have one of the best shields in the game in their face. One barrier can wildly shift a team fight, and with no strict timing for her to get to level 3, or guarantee that she will choose that perk, it makes it largely impossible to plan around going into a fight.

I don't want to go into a conversation about what forms of chaos are healthy, and which aren't, as that's a very long winded topic in and of itself. I will state that, in my opinion, the perk system itself is a level of healthy, fun chaos, but these issues introduced by the levelling is not.

My *personal* preference for fixing this would be to have every player *start* the game with their perks selected. This would give every character several ways to play in a match, from the very beginning. Low ranks and casual players would get more enjoyment out of the new system, and high ranked players would be able to better plan around perks, and the effect they have on team play. 

For some characters, this could mean significant changes to how they approach a fight, and very different skill expression. One Bastion player may start out their match with mobility from their grenade, and their assault form swapped with a tank. Right off the bat, they have different targets and intentions than base Bastion, but in turn that can be planned for ahead of time. In another match, you may face a Bastion who prefers to self-heal on solo flanks. Two players could have very different approaches to the same character, without the unfairness (or tedium) involved with that difference emerging late in the match.

As I said, this would be my preference. Other specifics, such as whether you would be able to swap perks mid-match, I don't really have a great answer for, as I see positives and negatives for both answers.

Others have suggested that levels should emerge *globally* through the match. While this wouldn't solve every issue, I do think it would generally be more fair than the current system.

Since the dawn of time has the cycle continued. Every player complained about heroes being weak, devs buff it, players complain heroes being strong. When you get perks for heroes, you get to decide which small buffs you wouldn‚Äôt complain about and play the hero the way you want. I just lost 3 games in a row but I don‚Äôt even care because I had so much fun playing heroes that felt buffed the way I want. Am I crazy? Is overwatch actually coming back??

2025-02-20 15:38:47,400 - INFO - Content: Literally the only other thing I want from OW2 now is for BP's to be permanently available
I know that a dev mentioned in Emongg's stream that people who want BP availability are a minority, but that's a statement that makes little sense to me. Who wants to be permanently locked out of some of the games best skins because they weren't playing that season? Especially with the new and returning players that are coming in as a result of this update. 

And even if it's true and it is a minority of players, this still sucks as a concept. I understand that they want to keep some amount of exclusivity in order to give Battle Passes value, but there has to be a certain point where that becomes irrelevant. Who is rocking skins from season 1 because they want to show off to players who weren't around for that season? The logic they used to justify making mythics available for everyone applies just as much to regular skins. 

In the olden days, skins were available by season (not counting anniversary event where every skin was available) so if you wanted a halloween skin you missed, you had to wait a year, but you could still get it once the time came. I think that worked perfectly fine as a time limit -  We get, what, 3-4 battlepasses a year? So give us a 3 season lag time before BP's start becoming completable again. Players who missed BP's can still buy them, so Blizzard doesn't lose out on money, players have something to do once they complete the current BP, and we have more skins to play for. This is a win for everyone.

Who wants to be permanently locked out of some of the games best skins because they weren't playing that season? Especially with the new and returning players that are coming in as a result of this update. 

And even if it's true and it is a minority of players, this still sucks as a concept. I understand that they want to keep some amount of exclusivity in order to give Battle Passes value, but there has to be a certain point where that becomes irrelevant. Who is rocking skins from season 1 because they want to show off to players who weren't around for that season? The logic they used to justify making mythics available for everyone applies just as much to regular skins. 

In the olden days, skins were available by season (not counting anniversary event where every skin was available) so if you wanted a halloween skin you missed, you had to wait a year, but you could still get it once the time came. I think that worked perfectly fine as a time limit -  We get, what, 3-4 battlepasses a year? So give us a 3 season lag time before BP's start becoming completable again. Players who missed BP's can still buy them, so Blizzard doesn't lose out on money, players have something to do once they complete the current BP, and we have more skins to play for. This is a win for everyone.

Not a big deal but I'm confused as to why they do this? these aren't "inspired" by Overwatch 1, they're the exact same.

It launches fast.

Like, *really* fast. You hit play and you're on the main menu in seconds.

That alone brings me back to the game often because launching another game often takes up to minutes at a time and while it's not very long, it still feels like a commitment when you just want a quick game.

Pretty impressive for an almost decade old game.

2025-02-21 13:36:37,144 - INFO - Content: The biggest perk outliers currently
So currently the biggest perk outliers | see (from games
& communities):

-Tracer's obviously need nerfs (really funny that even their own reddit are saying it feels wrong to be this op).

-Sombra obviously needs new ones (saw many agreeing that choosing no major perk is often ideal to preserve both hack range & ease of hack targeting in fights).

-Symmetra's appear impactful to the reader but 3/4 are worthless to actual Sym players 

(extra sentry doesn't make sentries good, 
tp range doesn't change her inability to 1v1 even supports, 
beam range only increases once you have charged it in close range so it's like a win-more,
regening shields equal to half a melee every sec if tp stays alive is very minor but is a 'major' perk).


Honorable mentions: Ash's will probably need nerfs.
Moira's will probably need buffs.

Agree/disagree? Anything else extreme that l forgot?

2025-02-21 19:11:08,205 - INFO - Content: My overwatch account got nuked, and I‚Äôm very confused by what happened
I exclusively play overwatch on console, I‚Äôve had the same account for about 3-4 years. Yesterday, I finished the rainy day mei drop on twitch and linked my twitch and battlenet accounts to claim the drop. That was all fine and good, but when I went to play, my entire account was cooked. My skins, my progress, my titles, my player icons, literally everything. I have put an embarrassing amount of money into skins over the years, so I had quite a few. Before someone tells me I linked the rainy day skin to the wrong account, I‚Äôm almost positive I didn‚Äôt. I make most of my purchases through my app, and I‚Äôve only ever had one account. No alt or anything. Even my app was nuked somehow, all my friends are gone and the battle pass and skins I bought 2 days ago are also showing as never purchased. I even had one of my ow friends check my account on their end and it shows me as a new player. I put a ticket in to support, but who knows how long that will take, so I‚Äôm here looking for guidance. Has this ever happened to anyone else? Also, the drop didn‚Äôt fully work, I got everything including the skin, except for the victory pose. The whole thing is just baffling to me and I could use some help if anyone has any insight.

2025-02-21 20:14:41,800 - INFO - Content: This and the other "Behind The Scenes" videos from the devs really show how much care and love that go into making the game. They didn't need to go to Peru, but they did because they want Runasapi to have culturally authentic sounds.
From the video's description:

"In the spring of 2024, Paul Lackey and I had the opportunity to travel to Peru to record sounds for the then-upcoming Peru map for Overwatch 2. The opportunity to travel for sound recording on behalf of Blizzard is rare, and not one we took for granted. For context, when sourcing sounds for a new map, we can usually find what we need through existing sound libraries or by contracting a sound recordist at the location we need. In this case, we didn't find enough relevant content in commercial sound libraries and it was more feasible to send Paul and I to Peru to record on location. We documented the trip ourselves, taking turns recording footage on our phones, and I edited this video to share our experience with the rest of the dev team.

Paul and I spent ten days traveling through Cusco, Pisac, Ollantaytambo, and Choquequirao. We've probably never walked so much in our lives. The 4-day trek to Choquequirao and back was particularly grueling, as that trek is known to be one of the more challenging ones in Peru. We chose to visit Choquequirao over Machu Picchu because we needed to record nature sounds, and Machu Picchu is simply too crowded with tourists. Choquequirao, being so difficult to access, sees about 10-20 visitors a day, while Machu Picchu sees about 4,000 visitors a day. The trek was tough, but we had an amazing guide, Ricardo Marim with Quechuas Expeditions that made sure we had everything we needed along the way. 

It's hard not to be moved by a place like this. The combination of being physically exhausted, being welcomed so warmly by the locals, and being surrounded by impossibly beautiful landscapes moved me to tears on a few occasions. When I look back at this footage I laugh at how barely articulate I am in the interview segments. It was all just so overwhelming. 

I hope you get something out of this video. This experience inspired me to go out and record more and spend more time in nature in general."
