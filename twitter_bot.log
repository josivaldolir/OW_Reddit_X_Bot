2025-03-06 20:15:38,561 - INFO - Content: What is your unpopular opinions/hot takes?
Curious what other people's are tbh. 

My main one is that people hating/wanting nerfs for famously annoying characters (such as sym, torb, roadhog, junkrat etc) is reasonable. I can see characters that people find annoying taking all the fun out of the match for some people. (I personally don't have too many hated characters but they're mostly dive purely because I mainly play ana). 

Oh and that old dps passive was better. That reload and moment speed was so damn fun.

Edit: my other main one is that ow simply was never made for console. Having to pick between long range accuracy with a lowER sensitivity or being able to actually turn around while being jumped by a tracer, sombra, genji etc is insane.

I feel like the amount you get is insanely low, Iâ€™ve played over 60 games now and only have around 1500, Iâ€™ve also nearly finished the battle pass before Iâ€™ve even gotten a single gun skin.

Thereâ€™s like 42 characters, I want to be able to get be able more than 3 of the weapon skins.. I understand that getting a lot of points from the  drives is a thing but I donâ€™t like waiting that long to be able to get them.

I just donâ€™t feel rewarded for actually playing comp when Iâ€™m mostly just playing it for the pretty guns.

Serious question. It takes months to years for things to be planned, developed, tested and implemented so how would it even be possible for them to create all this content in a matter of a few months. On top of that, are we going to pretend the last 2-3 years hasn't been constant upgrades, reworks, patches, balanced, new heroes, new maps, QoL changes, etc.?? Don't get me wrong I do believe there are some things OW2 brought in as a response to MR but it's no where near as much as a bunch of you claim. Lying to yourself to justify your hateboner is weird

I really enjoyed being able to vote on the player highlights after each match in the original Overwatch, but for some reason Overwatch 2 removed this fun feature. 

Does anyone else miss these post-match highlights too?

2025-03-07 13:00:23,196 - INFO - Content: In 7 years we will need to repeat mythic skins
Currently, there are 28 heroes without Mythic skins in the game. Every month and a half (one season), we get a new Mythic skin, and every three months (two seasons), we receive two Mythic skins and one new hero. If we keep up this pace (and the game still exists by then), in 7 years, all heroes in the gameâ€”including future onesâ€”will have Mythic skins.

We just need to follow the example of the next season (a month and a half), where we will get one more Mythic skin, reducing the number needed by 1 (28 - 1 = 27). However, we will also receive a new hero, adding one more needed Mythic skin (27 + 1 = 28). Then, in the following season (three months in total), we will only receive a Mythic skin, reducing the number by 1 again (28 - 1 = 27).

So, every three months, we reduce the number of remaining heroes without Mythic skins by 1. Multiplying 3 months by 28 skins gives us 84 months, which, when divided by 12 months in a year, totals 7 years.

I randomly thought about this while playing and found it funny, so I thought it would be cool to share. Do you think the game will still exist by then?


Edit. It's actually about 9 years, not 7, each season has 60 days, not 45.

But she is like my self insert character for a fiction I started writing a year ago and never finished lol. 


I hope to refine her design even more and make her believable, I love the ow art style so much ðŸ˜”

The rules are that all ability cooldowns are in hours instead of seconds and you have to have an ability which has a cooldown. Also it is natural that with any ability that uses equipment you have that equipment (e.g. ana's biotic grenade). 

My friend and I have discussed this and he thinks moira's fade (6h cooldown) would be the best and meanwhile i prefer tracer's blinks bc they can stack.
