2025-04-27 20:37:39,562 - INFO - Content: This is the best Overwatch has been in years and I’m tired of pretending it’s not


Yeah the launch of OW2 was a disaster, but I’m tired of having to pretend two years later that the game is still bad.

The current team of devs are significantly more ambitious and responsive to community woes than the OW1 team ever was. In just two seasons, the OW2 team has shown more willingness in shaking up the game and keeping it fresh than OW1 did in five years. Seriously, the only real shake-up OW1 got in that time was the introduction of role queue.

Now? Perks, hero bans, Stadium, map voting, etc. On top of that, the last four hero releases have been legitimately solid designs and great additions to the game. The game might not be what was promised, but the extent to which OW2 is a significantly better live service than OW1 needs to be studied.

Obviously the game still isn’t perfect, the monetization still sticks out as a sore point to me and I’d like to see them expand on the lore, but we’re a hell of a lot closer to that ideal now than we ever were back in the good old days.” I’m genuinely excited for the future of this game again.

Sometimes i see people fighting over who to buff and who to nerf, but when it comes to ships, I see people agreeing on how one is good and the other is perfect (this includes some of my friends groups).

To all the people that are complaining about Kiriko, Mercy, Rein getting all the skins, now it's time to act, now it's time to vote with your wallet.


Show the devs and shareholders that other heroes can also be profitable, show them that even if a hero is less popular there is still a chance to make money of it.

Especially if the skin is THAT good. I am not telling you to spend the money if you don't want to but if you are planning spending some this season maybe it's a good occasion.

I think making Sombra’s invisibility like Halo’s, where if you’re paying attention you’ll see it, would solve the issues that everyone has playing against her. She wouldn’t be banned so much and it would be a nerf yes but it could be mitigated by playing corners better.

2025-04-29 04:17:25,904 - INFO - Content: I built StadiumBuilds.io for my wife
Yesterday, I built a small app called StadiumBuilds.io. My wife plays a lot of Overwatch and has been getting into learning Moira Builds. She was frustrated because there was no real place to organize, share, or browse builds easily, so I decided to make something for her.

It was just supposed to be a small side project for fun. I hacked it together in about a day and showed it to her. She loved it and posted it in a Facebook group she is part of. Within 24 hours, we had over 25 users uploading and sharing their stadium builds. Some people even started sending suggestions, which I tried to implement as quickly as possible.

I honestly did not expect much. I just wanted to make something useful for her, but seeing it actually help other players too has been pretty cool. I am not trying to make money off it or anything. I just thought it was worth sharing because sometimes the small, personal projects end up being the ones people connect with the most.

If you want to check it out or share feedback, that would be awesome. I am still adding features and would love to hear what players actually want instead of guessing.

Thanks for reading.
