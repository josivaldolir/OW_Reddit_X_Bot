2025-03-09 10:38:33,713 - INFO - Content: Where am I supposed to practice if not Quick Play?
The past couple days I've been working on practicing Symmetra. I adored her in OW1 but her new playstyle since the rework has never really clicked with me. 

I don't really have any DPS characters I play well, so I've been trying to practice Symm to just get a feel of how she works and try to really put in the effort to learn her new kit. 

Admittedly, it hasn't been going great. I do struggle a lot. I die a lot. I don't always deal the most damage. I don't always get the most value. There's a lot to consider with her kit and it's more than I'm used to.

I've been getting flamed by teammates and even opponents. Today in a game the enemy tank kept saying how I may as well have been helping his team win, and my team was joining in saying how awful I had been playing.

It was Quick Play, though. Where else am I supposed to practice a hero if not in Quick Play? Am I doing something wrong by playing subpar in that mode?

When is the mid season patch so they can put that old man in his grave. Like my team will be winning and then boom Torb. It’s no more point for us. 300-400 heath. Turret that hits like a truck… that also has the dps passive for whatever fucking reason. He has no fall off. His damage is crazy. The perk being able to put his turret on a wall was the biggest mistake they possibly could’ve done. It’s just like the Illari situation but with damage. I’m just wondering why no one is talking about how annoying it is to play against him.

2025-03-09 16:13:33,812 - INFO - Content: We put our differences aside for a group photo because the game wouldn’t give us a second support in QP
Started a quickplay match yesterday and almost immediately saw one of the other team’s support players leave the match. Then the game just kinda…didn’t give them a replacement.

I’ve seen this happen a few times recently, and it looks like it’s a bug. Felt pretty unfair to keep at it as a 5v4, so we all took the opportunity to take a group photo. Watching everyone organize for the pic in text chat was great.

See, OW2 isn’t toxic ALL the time!

Photo credit goes to the other team’s Sombra, King!

2025-03-09 23:35:16,882 - INFO - Content: In my opinion Ramattra "rework" should come back as selectable perk.
When Ramattra was reworked they changed punching through shield with a destorying shield faster. While it was really dissapointing for most of the community, in my opinion it should come back as selectable perk.

I am thinking about it mostly because of Zarya, as Ramattra was able to destroy her bubble in 2 punches. Selectable minor perk that turns him into her counter would be IMO fun and flexible idea. But it's not only about Zarya, if we increase numbers a bit it could be good counter to for example Winston who bubbles your team very randomly.

To sum up, while the heck not? Let me choose between punching for better self offence and weaker punching that is more team oriented.

I'm so sick of post game banter being removed from the game. 
Listen, I get it, some people don't want to be exposed to trash talk. However, I don't do that. I love friendly banter, I thrive talking to both my team mates and enemy's about our game. 

For players that do not want to he exposed to Randoms on the internet, you can Mute or Leave chat, we have options for you. 

I find it insulting that everyone is universally told they cannot talk about the match after the match. I get so worked up and angry when I try to type something, but I cannot finish in time and things get left unsaid or unfinished. It's the cause of more keyboard smashes for me, than losing rounds. 

Anyone else want the post match chat back?

When I play QP, I have a blast. I feel like I'm somewhat evenly matched and if I lose, no big deal. Rarely do I find toxic people. Most people are chill.

When I play comp, I have a terrible time. Every match is either a nail-biter or a stomp (against me). I feel like I am outclassed by the people in the lobby. I get flamed and have to deal with toxics way more than chill people.

Anyone else feel the same?

2025-03-10 12:29:49,674 - INFO - Content: The downside to projectile sizes that no one talks about
As a hitscan enjoyer, I was neutral to the projectile size changes when they were first announced. Sure, it means you have to be slightly less accurate to land shots, but that’s not really a major downside, even for aim purists. Given how fast everyone moves in this game, having more hit consistency isn’t necessarily a bad thing.

However, the downside that often gets overlooked is how some character models and animations position their hands in front of their heads—examples include but not limited to: Kiriko while throwing Kunais, Ana while shooting, Echo while using abilities, and even Moira during Coalescence. Because the projectile size is now larger, these hand/arm animations can obstruct headshots, causing shots that would've previously hit the head to register on a limb instead, resulting in significantly less damage.

This is particularly bad for heroes like Cass, who rely almost exclusively on headshots to win duels. With the current projectile size buff, I’m convinced it punishes precision players more than it helps them. Rather than rewarding accuracy, it creates situations where well-placed shots are unintentionally blocked by animation quirks—leading to fewer confirmed kills for players who aim well. I know this is anecdotal now as I've only noticed it in game, but I'll find and post examples when i have time if anyone's interested.

There will be recolors of the first collab for all five Heroes. Apparently you can earn the Junkrat Legendary again. Obviously new dance emotes (guessing an extra Ramattra one since it was teased in the Reddit AMA). And for everybody asking how Bob will look like: We already have seen a glimpse of him in the Music Video shared in 2023 where he is dressed as a Bodyguard. The Members of Le Sserafim choose who gets the Skins.

sojourn deserves proper skins.

the dokiwatch theme lends itself to cute concepts.

it is reminiscent of the star guardian and stellar protector series in league of legends/paladins.

So many skins are about completely changing the heroes' look and basically turning them into something else entirely (mostly mythological figures).

But it feels like it's been so long since we've just had... the heroes just being themselves in a cool outfit ? Not Mercy as an evil witch or the entire east asian pantheon, just Anzela Ziegler dressing up to look sharp. The last time we've got something like this was probably the formal skins last christmas, or the last k-pop collab.

The streetwear/hypebeast theme looks so cool too, it's a shame it's only been used for 2 collabs so far, and is basically restricted to females heroes because of it.

^^Also ^^it ^^would ^^be ^^the ^^perfect ^^occasion ^^for ^^a ^^lucio ^^mythic

just a fun thread. Think of what your absolute favourite non-Overwatch IP, character or brand that would make you scream in excitement if they got a skin! 

Personally, I have been very against collabs until now. knowing there are other characters or series I'd actually care about getting a collab in Overwatch would get me buying instantly. really helped me come to peace with the idea and now I'm brainstorming what I want to see! atm the only characters that got a collab that are genuinely liked characters myself are sylvanas and ochaco. i missed those because of my personal vendetta against the idea apart from Lesserafim, but will probably wait for future collabs to see who will come next.

Aaaanyway, that vent is over. now for the fun part!

Sanrio characters: Kuromi is my Spirit animal, would buy a skin based on her and cherish it so much! My Melody and Cinnamoroll too! thankfully those characters seem likely if Sanrio collabed. 

Bionicle: will never happen probs, but heroes getting skins based on the 6 toa tribes would be sweeeeeet. my childhood and favourite toyline ever!

Is there any IPs you adore dearly and mean lots to you that you'd love to see?  Which characters?

Hello!

You might recognize me as the guy who made the comic "HAPPY NATION" ( https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1gpf9rx/happy_nation_the_first_comic_of_mine_that_takes/ )
and I RETURN!

This next issue is in full color, as a lot of people previously mentioned how they wanted to see my work in color as opposed to the black/white/red theming I had going on.

I'm almost done coloring the comic and then putting in dialogue, which will probably take me another couple weeks. But I wanted to show that l'm almost done, and that l've still got more down the pipeline. I look forward to showing you all the full issue, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised as to what's inside and what's coming! :)

DM eats projectiles right? Well, I say class Invisible Sombra as a projectile and let Dva eat her. The enemy Sombra can't respawn as they have been completely disintegrated down to the molecular level.

I think this would be a good balance change, as it increases the risk for Sombra to go Invisible.

I swear like 9 times out of 10 whenever I queue for all roles, I get put in as a tank. The daily challenge for 'a classy flex' might as well just say play tank 3x, because that's what ends up happening. do yall also have this experience or is it just me?

I find it amusing and insightful to see what people were saying about certain ideas in OW back in the day. Has the experience of the player base changed affected this opinion? Or was it the game that changed too much? Maybe a little bit of both?

So I m curious who are u going to Ban most (except widow we all saw it coming).


For me personally I will always vote for zarya no matter what role I play she is the most "counter watch" hero in the game and I find her more annoying to deal with than doom and mauga.

2025-03-14 13:00:23,241 - INFO - Content: Why does tank feel so exhausting to play?
Is this just me? Am I crazy😭😭😭???

I feel like playing tank is so tiring. I can only play a few games without getting exhausted and going back to dps or support. 

And it’s not because I’m bad at the role or anything, I’m a high ranked player and I could win every single game of tank with no counters and still feel fed up of the role. No matter which tank it is. I can play support for hours and at max like 3 tank games at a time 😭😭😭 

Why is this 🙁 I played so much tank in ow1 and now I hate it , did I just lose my passion for it? I get there’s a little more work when playing tank now that it’s 5v5 but that never really bothered me

Didn’t even realize that I hit diamond on DPS because the icon looked so similar to the plat one. Then I noticed the difference and gave myself a pat :) Mainly Moira/Ana/Brig/Weaver(tho I’m bad with him) and on DPS primarily Torb, Sojurn, Pharah, Mei, Sombra, Widow (rarely cause it’s hard on this hardware) and yea sometimes other stuff just depends

Recently someone posted about Freja being the same as widow, and it was said that overwatch has a “same face syndrome” that’s news for me. I’ve always seen overwatch as a master class in hero design and every character as recognizable, I can tell apart every one by silhouette and face structure, I’m sorry but I think that if you think this is the same character you’re just bad at faces

2025-03-15 04:39:57,605 - INFO - Content: my ow is lagging like CRAZY
i dont even know what to do anymore everyone obviously absolutely hates me "L TANK WTF"  even if i say sorry im lagging 😭 ive seen that some other ppl are also experiencing this on ps4  so idk if it's the game or what🥲 rlly sucks. it doesnt always lag but when it does it just hits randomly and the lag is BAD (usually not this bad though, mostly it's just throwing me in places and then the game throws me out etc)  

anyone have any tips? is this happening to anyone else?

2025-03-15 07:13:28,073 - INFO - Content: Be kind to your Tank. They need it.
I've made posts about how Tank can sometimes be absolutely miserable.

Unfortunately, part of that is on the community. Tank is by far the role that gets the most abuse. Its also the role with the least amount of players. Funny, huh?

Your tank may be having a bad game. It happens. We all have bad games. But is telling the most important player on your team to kill themselves because they aren't doing exactly what you want worth it?

As a tank player myself, it can become mentally exhausting. Every game, even if you are winning, someone's telling you what to do, what they think you are doing wrong, or just straight up abusing you. Everyone always blames you. Today, for example, we lost one fight and my Zen told me to "go die". I've turned chat off before, but there's no point, they'll just DM you telling you to off yourself instead.

Tank is the most stressful role in the game. And when things aren't going right, it's also the most miserable.

But a good compliment or reassurance can really lift a Tank's spirits. We never, ever get any kindness. It'll make their day. 

So please, consider kindness to your Tank. They've probably been told horrible things before your game. They deserve some nicer vibes.

2025-03-15 08:41:23,404 - INFO - Content: Freja's design looks like a moth
I haven't seen this posted anywhere or anyone talking about this on the forum, so my bad if someone already brought this up and I just missed it. But like, as soon as I saw her design I immediately thought she was 100% intended to look like a moth. She has the cape as wings, the hair ties as antennae, and most obviously the fuzzy lining on her hood as the fuzzy part of a moth. I don't know if anyone else noticed this or thought this but I've seen a lot of posts talking about her design but none of them mentioning this. Part of her kit is flying/gliding in the air. Her hair ties literally go over her head like antennae in some of her concept art. Like??? It seems pretty obvious

So I think sigmas mythic weapon should…

Be fruit, I know it sounds weird but I think fruit really fits his whole character arc it it allows some really unique weapon and a really cool kill effect, so first off I think this balls should estimate between apples, oranges, pears and lemons, the round ish fruits as they won’t mess up visuals too much, and who doesn’t want to throw fruit at people. 

And his flourish could him just taking a bite out of the fruit. He needs his five a day of course 


His acreciation  mass should be a watermelon. End of story it just fits 


Shield could stay the same, maybe have a tie for pattern with fruit juice, I’m not picky 


His absorb ability should be a plum with swirls of fruit juice. Sigma likes plums and balls

And his ultimate should and will be him playing fruit ninja. Perfection. Each kill slices them and then plays the kill effect, you cannot beat this. Sigma loves fruit ninja.


And his kill effect? He pops people like a watermelon, with chunks flying everywhere. Again, perfection 


While you could argue that his mythic should be based upon music, and that’s an idea I’d like to experiment with, fruit just… works.

As someone who plays all of the 3 heroes I can totally understad each point of view. I just wish that at least in quickplay people would prefer having fun / learning the match up rather than swapping as soon as they die.

I've been playing this game since 2016 launch and only recently have been seeing a lot of people in chat complain about people "countering".

It honestly makes no sense to me because that's like the point of the whole game? Why is a genji gonna stand around getting their ass whooped by a moira when he can't reflect her? Or as a tank why keep getting bombs lobbed at me from junkrat when I can switch to Zarya and protect myself?

Idk the whole idea that I need to stick to the same person I picked at the beginning of the match is dumb

I’m honestly happy about the skins she’s gotten over the last two seasons, but allll her skins from before are so bad in MY opinion. I’m wondering if anyone else thinks the same thing. I’m hoping that for the magical girls skin her skin turns out good, I wish that blizzard would outsource to people who make fan concepts because the sombra ones I’ve seen are so good! Up top are examples of good fan concepts

at first i assumed i was lagging out without it dropping frames but the second clip was part of play of the game and i realized others were seeing me fly up in the air too. does anyone know why i started flying like this, no perks i know of would make this happen? i even wondered if the zen had the knockback perk or something but he was using transcendence and not near me when i first started flying so i’m not sure

2025-03-16 14:12:25,386 - INFO - Content: Wifi disconnected mid-match, but it looks like a bot controlled my character after I left?
Basically the title, I was playing a comp match on Midtown and towards the last 20 seconds of the game I was really laggy and got disconnected. When I finally logged back in, I went back to watch the replay to see if we won or not and it looks like after I lagged out a bot took over or something and capped the point with the rest of my team.  

Replay Code: TKRJ8 
I’m Medic (Sombra) I got kicked around 7:10. Before that you can see me run into walls (lagging) and after I hack the health pack sombra makes a sharp 90 degree turn, runs toward the objective, shoots at Ashe, hit a virus, and move around on the objective to cap with me team.
I don’t remember any of this happening or seeing the “victory” after hacking the med pack by the stairs. Is this a new feature, or was I doing it without knowing while being kicked out? 

Also, because it looks like I was active till the end of the game, do I still get penalized as if I left the game? Thanks for any info you can give me!

Tier list purely based on the coldest ultimate voice lines in the game. This is not me saying I don't like Lifeweaver's for example, I still think it's great.

My top 5:

1. Ramattra - "Suffer, as I have."
2. Sojourn 
3. Soilder 76
4. Hanzo/Genji
5. Cassidy

2025-03-16 15:35:56,531 - INFO - Content: Overwatch helps me sleep
I have trouble sleeping often, but lately overwatch has been helping with this.
When I try to sleep my brain races with big picture thoughts and scary existential debate, it's incredibly difficult to sleep under these conditions.
But luckily, I've found a solution, I have some extra blankets on my bed that I roll up, I lie facing them closely, and imagine Junker Queen is holding me tightly into her chest and cuddling me to sleep.
I typically play support or rarely damage characters, so I like to imagine she's keeping me safe and taking the damage for me, just like in the game, and I'm providing her comfort and utility as well.
It's worked pretty well so far for me, does anyone else do this too? If so, do you also do it with Junker Queen, or is there another character you prefer?

Hello again, everyone :). Been on a small Juno kick recently, resulting in a dumpy, cute smaller Juno...and then that triggered another idea. I already have larger globes, and she came from Mars on a spaceship, so why not make her in a cute little ship?! I know it's doesn't look like her actual ship, but I think it turned out cute!

The top can pop off, and the little Juno can be freed. She's a bean with no feeties XD, but with some fiddling, she sits on her little booty all by herself. 

I'm not going to ruin it, but I ordered something that'll make this design so cool. I won't have those bits in for a few weeks, though. Till then, hope yall enjoy the little flying saucer Juno!

Thank you all for your support. Every upvote and comment means so much to me <3. I'm just so happy I can make things that others will get enjoyment out of.

Based on a poll made earlier by u/ImperialViking_, this poll is meant to capture Ult voice lines from ANY POV, friendly or enemy.  
  
I also took into account some Mythic voice lines in this (e.g. Ana "You're powered up, DESTROY them". 

List might not be perfect but this was just my take on it.

Little meatball man has the hp of a tank, a gun with a shotgun and sniper at once (basically reaper and meis gun in one), a turret he can sit behind and just hammer up, not to mention perks that allow him to yeet a turret to absurd angles.

I don't understand how to counter this mf. In my past dozen games, just about every one of them had a torb.

We were so confused about where our tank was. When I died it showed me the tank’s pov and at first I thought they were hiding in spawn, me and my duo went to look for them and they weren’t there. I watched the replay and they were stuck at the previous point 😭 I also just thought the realization they had that nobody was there with them pretty funny lol.

2025-03-17 12:29:17,224 - INFO - Content: A few things ive noticed as a newbie to OW2 and FPS’s as a whole!.
Hey all! Nice to post here again. I recently started OW2 and have been having a BLAST. I recently got my first POTG as soldier!. But ive also notice a few things about OW2 that I haven’t really seen from the very few FPS games I’ve played. When I was playing the game i found myself repeatedly thinking to myself how responsive and good the game feels. And I also found myself thinking about how awesome the characters look. Some don’t have designs I like but 99% do!. And the skins are awesome too!. Also so far the community has been pretty friendly to me. But man this game feels awesome to play, the maps, the characters, the feel of the game, just love it all!. I actually want to improve and get better unlike some games where i get bored really quickly!. So far it’s a lovely time.

EAD8H5

  
This has to be the longest clash game I've ever felt, this was longer than most ranked games..

Enemy ball and I refused to die/swap, kept playing no matter what, and the teams both had low damage high sustain comps at the end making it almost impossible for one to cap.

2025-03-18 17:13:36,186 - INFO - Content: The Myth of Overextending
So I've seen on this reddit a lot people talking about "over-extending" being a reason for dying, but this is actually a well known internet misconception much like the omitted logic behind NASA's expensive pens. It's important to always go in every time even if you ditch the team around a corner. Why? The reason is simple, you can't build up an immunity to dying without dying. It's much like how in order to become immune to snake bites you let them bite you in smaller increments and eventually you will be able to survive multiple snakes at once.

The Hanzo standing directly in front of the nano boosted enemy Mauga? He is limit testing, sharpening his mind with every button he presses. Not only is he much wiser than you for doing this, he will come out of spawn even stronger than before because he is learning the nano boosted point blank Mauga matchup while YOU may never learn how to outplay when you inevitably find yourself in this scenario.

What we really need to talk about on this sub is the very real phenomenon of UNDER extending. And we all know the cause: fear. The mind killer. Ashe takes a long time to reload, but actually if you stand in point blank range, not only does your coach gun deal vastly more damage, but you can melee the enemy without any need to reload. It's just basic damage optimization that you should be up close. Mercy has an ability that specifically is designed to let her fly towards an ally so she can get in range to be more accurate with her gun. Zenyatta deals additional damage when he kicks enemies. Lifeweaver has an ability specifically designed to force your teammates to get closer to the enemy.

The next time you see your teammate "overextend" just think to yourself "I should have also gone in, stay hard, no excuses" and you'll quickly rank up. Probably.

2025-03-19 08:19:27,278 - INFO - Content: Came back to Overeatch after 3 months of playing the game which shall not be named and
I realized that how much quality OW has. Let me say that i really like the fact that OW finally has a competition so that OW has to do something to protect it's spot. Even after 3 months, i just couldn't love the MR. As an OW veteran since the first ever beta, OW still feels incredible.

Whether we were in content drought or recent lack of creativity in skins (i hate those recolors), OW has a solid feeling. In OW, every shot and skill has an impact and you feel like doing something. But in MR, that feeling is very cheap and everything just goes bazoonka.

Just played a couple of OW matches and i wish i have never left. But perhaps this change was needed for me to see what MR does things differently than OW.

Recent changes are really big and i can't wait for Aqua.

Ty for reading my TED write.

2025-03-19 11:35:51,524 - INFO - Content: There's no way the same people made all the perks
It feels like 2 different teams made them. One team made them with drawbacks in mind, the other just made straight buffs to the character.

Soldier has to anti himself to gain a buff, Ashe shoots faster but less damage, Cassidy has to let his ult run out to even gain a positive effect from his, Echo shoot more missles but less damage, Junkrat faster ult but less damage, etc.

Ana has 0 negatives on hers and they're all S tier perks, Tracer 3 blinks on recall, Sojourn 15 extra ammo, Torb turret perks, Rammatra having a shotgun and self healing on basic ability, etc. 

Makes some characters just feel like shit when some of them get amazing perks with great ideas or great buffs, while others get shafted with not nearly the same power. Ashe can choose to do less damage while Ana can just Nano someone else and herself at the same time? You're not even trying to hide your favoritism at this point.

I was buzzing to try 6v6 again in this new comp mode, but most of my games so far have been me desperately trying to fill holes and convince my teammates to pick something even half useful. Overwatch has been out for  almost a decade and people are still trying to run no tank in comp. 2-2-2 keeps everything so simple. Everyone knows their role and what they need to do. Whenever I see 3 dps I know the games basically lost already

2025-03-20 05:15:40,379 - INFO - Content: Soj and Zarya are straight up ruining this perks update
I understand they were going for “if everyone is OP then no one is” but come on… Soj was nerfed because she absolutely was broken for a long time and you just gave it all back to her with a perk! Don’t even get me started on the mercy pockets. 

Then Zarya, as a support main watching any tank try to have fun and play anything into Zarya is depressing. They have to insta switch just to stand a chance. I’m yet to win a game into Zarya when our tank was anything else. 

The devs can be so good with noticing things and so oblivious, it’s like they have two separate balance change teams and neither of them actually play the game. 

Also can we talk about Ana… as a lifeweaver main, my major perk is to add 30 healing every 5 seconds by forcing me to use my self-heal/mobility cd, it’s so bad! The perk system is fun don’t get me wrong but they’re so unbelievably skewed into heroes that were already very strong. 

Please devs can you just play your own game and you’ll experience what we are.

So, I joined this game because someone left. I noticed the game had been going on for 30+ minutes, I wanted to finish it since I'm playing QP not for Role-Playing in quick play. They hated me for trying to end the match. What do you think of this? Should I have left the game, giving myself a penalty for leaving, or are they wrong? Ps.

2025-03-20 20:16:05,338 - INFO - Content: "It's just Quick Play, don't take it so seriously"
I've seen this line of argument far too often in discussions of people "roleplaying," or otherwise screwing around in QP instead of actually playing the objective. "If you want to play the game seriously, go play comp" is another common argument I see. 

**Quick Play is the mode where Overwatch is supposed to be played normally.** It's supposed to be the baseline game mode, not comp. Just because it's "casual" doesn't negate the fact that it's supposed to be the place where the average player goes to play the game by the normal rules, as it was intended to be played. Comp is for just that - people who want to play the game COMPETATIVELY. You shouldn't be forced to play that to avoid throwing and "screwing around for fun".

I play soccer casually. If I joined a casual soccer team, and went to a casual soccer game, and then started having a tea party with our goalie on the sidelines instead of playing the game like the rest of our team, do you think people would accept my answer if I said "bro, this isn't Major League Soccer, if you want to play the game normally go join the Atlanta United FC, stop taking this so seriously"? We would rightly be mocked for such logic and get kicked from the team.

If you want to RP/chat/screw around/whatever, that's what Custom Games are for. **That's the casual you are talking about**. Quick Play is not so casual you can just ignore how the game is meant to be play and talk condescendingly towards those frustrated with you for ruining their games. You are intentionally trying to ruin other player's experiences by playing like that in Quick Play. 

To be clear, I say all this as someone who plays a fair amount of Competative. I get not everyone wants to play the game that seriously; I don't believe they should be punished for playing the game as it was meant to be playing in the game mode designed for the average person to do that.

**TL;DR: Quick Player is for playing the game normally, you're being stupid and selfish for trying to justify throwing in it "for fun".**

EDIT: To be clear, I'm not taking a dig at people trying to get better at heroes that may not be their best in Quick Play. People have to learn somewhere, and QP is 100% the place to do that. I take issue with people who troll their teammates genuinely trying to improve at the game (or who are there to just play normally) and then make excuses for it

This was in QP. I'm trying to get better with various heroes, but it's scenarios like this that make me go back into my comfort zone.

I’d love to see this in the future.
Basically, in the animated short; alive. Widow uses her grapple to hang herself upside down in a building. This would be such a unique perk idea, where her grapple that pulls her (say if you press it again) then hangs her upside down like torbs wall turret perk. It wouldn’t be broken but I could see alot if future scenarios where this would be useful. 

I hope we get it in the future with the perks being changed 🤞

I think Freja looks REALLY interesting with a great design and even better lore implications, but it seems like the hype for Freja just…isn’t there?

There was a LOT of excitement for other recent heroes, especially Venture and Juno, but it seems like Freja isn’t really gaining the momentum any of last year’s heroes did

Could it just be burnout from new heroes being talked about more since they all have tests before release now? Does Freja just not capture people’s attention as much because of her more muted design? Is it because she’s a high-skill hero?

Freja seems like an interesting hero with a lot of potential, but the hype just doesn’t seem to be there! r/FrejaMains is like…dead
