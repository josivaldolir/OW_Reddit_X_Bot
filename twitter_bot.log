2025-02-22 15:13:21,017 - INFO - Content: The loot boxes and perks definitely make the game feel better.
I've gone from playing only when a friend hit me up for some matches, which could be once or twice a week, to playing a few matches nearly every day.

The loot boxes are nice simply because fashion is the endgame of any live service game worth it's salt. If I'm gonna be dping the same shit hundreds or thousands of times I wanna do it in *style*, dammit. And the LBs giving me a bunch of cosmetics definitely helps.

But the perks? Hooo boy. The perks add some spice to an already fast & flashy combat experience. Just going into fights and never being exactly sure what the opponent is going to be capable of, and you being able to surprise them as well, is so damned fun. Had absolute curb stomp games turned on their heads when people's perks came online. Some more impactful than others, yes, but plenty of surprises to be had. Torb sticking turrets onto ceilings? Mauga setting people on fire with his stomp? Kiriko throwing out healing every time she lands a kunai? Genji having goddamned lifesteal on Dragon Blade?

Yeah. It's been fun. Some of these perks need to be changed but it's mostly been a good time.

2025-02-22 17:36:32,463 - INFO - Content: How do y’all feel about counter swapping?
Had a game where the enemy team’s dps swapped to symmetra and Mei to help counter my tank (sigma). Made sense to me cuz we were absolutely rolling them and if they didn’t find a way to mow down our tank we were gonna have a first point victory. They swapped and started rolling us. My tank swapped to Zar to counter their Dva and not be weak to beam users. (In my opinion - smart)

Well the other team got salty cuz the swap instantly stopped the one sided beat down again.

As a personal victory I told their supports to hush and then aced. I was reaper the whole game.

2025-02-22 18:17:37,942 - INFO - Content: Is it worth it to counter-switch now that you also lose perk progression?
Perks have been out for a good few days now, and I was wondering how this changes the whole "Counterwatch" gameplay.

I'm not sure if it was intentionally or not, but now once your character has progressed a couple levels, you're essentially hard locked into them. When switching heroes, you lose all perk progression. Now, especially if you've already unlocked a major perk, you're at risk for a major nerf when switching heroes after a few minutes into the game. Of course though, it also allows you to choose perks throughout the game that may not keep you hard-countered if you were previously having trouble.

This is certainly an interesting change that drastically effects the gameplay. How often do you swap heroes now? Under what conditions do you do so, if ever?
