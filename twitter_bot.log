It's always ''doom switch''. If my DPS are both doing really poorly and dying too much, it's only because they have no shield tank apparently. I got called the r word and a ''doom bot'' because I didn't switch to Zarya at a random's request. And also that I should switch because with Doom we have ''3 dps''. I legit enjoy the character and want to win but this is getting ridiculous.

2025-03-03 21:13:40,973 - INFO - Content: Overwatch doesn‚Äôt do enough to stop downrankers/smurfs
For reference, I‚Äôm gold. Im pretty comfortable with the idea that I suck, but I play to have fun, so whatever.

I just got out of a match with a fairly obvious Smurf account in a 5 stack who spent the match on sojourn with a mercy pocket and absolutely annihilated my entire team over and over. By the end of the game, they had 100 eliminations and the closest on my team was about 17 or 18. 

Then, just when we were about to lose, they‚Äôd all stand back off point and let us cap, just to drag the game out longer. They let it go all the way to the 4th round then c9ed and let us take the win. 

They plugged a twitch account at the end of the match and their stream title was ‚Äòbronze account smurfing‚Äô

They wasted 40 minutes of our lives, and even if the account gets banned, they can make another one with a 2$ sim card from a petrol station and rinse and repeat. I‚Äôm frustrated and I feel that this is one of the main reasons the game is dying.

Jared was responsible for a lot of the positive changes for OW2, Legacy credits, free new heroes etc. and was brave enough to break the sad news about PvE.

I remember Jared replied to me personally confirming the story missions will have AI teammates for solo play, I'll miss his interactions with the community.

Who could be the next executive producer??

So for context, I was in a trio with my buddies, them on pc and me on console, so we were in a mixed pool quickplay. At one point, the enemy Reinhardt pinned me against a wall and I instantly clipped into their spawn from across the map and died to spawn room damage. Anybody seen anything like this before?

2025-03-04 11:12:22,371 - INFO - Content: Am I crazy or did the devs say they were going to reduce the amount of times a solo queue would face stacks?
Particularly in the Tank role, I'm rather tired of getting a match the *nanosecond* I press Requeue, because I'm the only guy on the server dumb enough to solo queue Tank and there's 100s of stacks waiting their turn to feast on my SR. 

I know I'm the long straight piece in the matchmaker's game of Tetris, but can you please consider my experience as well instead of throwing me into these matchups over and over? This is a huge reason that Tank gets even worse as less people play. It's a problem that feeds itself. At the very least you gotta stop allowing people to queue as a 2 DPS+2 Support four stack. What are we doing here.

The voice/emote/spray wheel could have easily handled 6, 8, or even 10 options.
