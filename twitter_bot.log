Out of all the Overwatch cinematics, especially the newer ones that are just meant to introduce characters.

This one manages to tell an actually emotional story, introduces viewer to lore and its charachters and ‚Äútechnically‚Äù progresses the story forward. It very short time that it has it achieves a lot.

2025-07-06 04:07:46,614 - INFO - Content: I‚Äôm dumbly jealous of Mercy players
This is so dumb. Like, extremely dumb. Trust me, I know. But I was hoping someone in here could relate. 

I could be playing my ass off. Like, healing tf out of everyone. 10+ saves in a match, really going in, you know? Only for my team to be like ‚ÄúCLUTCH MERCY‚Äù or ‚Äúily mercy‚Äù or ‚Äúmercy is the goat‚Äù. 

I‚Äôve had matches where I have done literally over 2k more healing than the mercy on my team, yet my entire team will be hyping up the mercy at the end of the match. Like, I understand the revive, but come on. 

I‚Äôm not a stingy Moira. I focus on my team and throw more healing orbs than damage. I run out of my healing spray so often in every match that I play. 

Literally just finished a match where I had over 10k healing, and our Mercy had her pistol out the majority of the match with 6k healing, and someone sent in the chat ‚Äúyalls mercy trash. ours is the goat‚Äù meanwhile I saved their ass at least 3 times in the match. 

I‚Äôm definitely just venting, and again, this is so so dumb. But like, no one ever thanks the Moira. üòîüòîüòî

2025-07-06 05:16:04,664 - INFO - Content: Devs if you read this /r - and I know you do - please add Dark Mode
I play a lot later during the day without lights on, and the light background really grinds my gears, especially because UI in terms of theme is inconsistent - challenges and play has dark background and sometimes menu screen is, but other ones are not, and you go to menu or heroes page and you're eyes are immediately hit with a lot of white light.

My cosplay for Anime Expo 2025! 

This is my first completely handmade cosplay and I even included his spinning back petal! Even though I am not as tall- nor buff as Lifeweaver is‚Ä¶ I still had so much fun cosplaying him. Thank you to everybody who asked for pictures or gave compliments!
