From a round in stadium, no one on my team died in the round yet every person on the other team got a kill. I’ve never seen this before, just genuinely confused.

2025-05-11 17:37:59,740 - INFO - Content: I love Overwatch 2 but it seems like its detrimental to my mental health
TL;DR: Overwatch 2 is my favorite game. I don't want to play anything else, but at the same time, it makes me feel depressed. Do I just stop playing my favorite game?

  
Sorry but I have nowhere else to post this and no one to talk it with  
  
I feel miserable. I hate that I love this game, but people only use chats to flame. When I turn it off, they find some way to piss me off. Even when I'm winning, I still feel annoyed for some unknown reason. I hate that Sombra exists, I hate the unbalancing, I hate that even after taking a very long break I manage to experience this emotion that I've never felt anywhere else before and my chest feeling hot due to anger. Seriously I wish it was different. I really love this game, I even got addicted at some point. There have been a lot of times that it gets to my head and I want to just take it out on someone but maybe that's just online gaming for you, but OW2 is just different somehow

I just love this game. I dont want to play anything else, not MR, not TF2, and definitely not Paladins. I even learned Blender to create fanart. The picture is from an obscure animation that I made

How do I cope with this? Do I just stop playing my favorite game?
