TL;DR: Overwatch 2 is my favorite game. I don't want to play anything else, but at the same time, it makes me feel depressed. Do I just stop playing my favorite game?

  
Sorry but I have nowhere else to post this and no one to talk it with  
  
I feel miserable. I hate that I love this game, but people only use chats to flame. When I turn it off, they find some way to piss me off. Even when I'm winning, I still feel annoyed for some unknown reason. I hate that Sombra exists, I hate the unbalancing, I hate that even after taking a very long break I manage to experience this emotion that I've never felt anywhere else before and my chest feeling hot due to anger. Seriously I wish it was different. I really love this game, I even got addicted at some point. There have been a lot of times that it gets to my head and I want to just take it out on someone but maybe that's just online gaming for you, but OW2 is just different somehow

I just love this game. I dont want to play anything else, not MR, not TF2, and definitely not Paladins. I even learned Blender to create fanart. The picture is from an obscure animation that I made

How do I cope with this? Do I just stop playing my favorite game?

Unless there's some Street Fighter reason I'm missing out on, this feels incredibly forced. Juri doesn't even use weapons and, if she did, she's way more likely to be like Widowmaker, not a support. Ibuki LITERALLY uses kunai. I know Juri as this crazy cat foot fetishist lady, not a... healing ninja kitsune girl. Ibuki just feels like a much better choice.

Unless there's some Street Fighter reason I'm missing out on, this feels incredibly forced. Juri doesn't even use weapons and, if she did, she's way more likely to be like Widowmaker, not a support. Ibuki LITERALLY uses kunai. I know Juri as this crazy cat foot fetishist lady, not a... healing ninja kitsune girl. Ibuki just feels like a much better choice.

This question came to my head because I JUST finished watching Arcane and oh my gosh if you haven’t watched it then PLEASE WATCH IT. It is quite literally peak fiction. One thing I admired about the show was that despite the fact that I know literally 0 things about LOL, I was able to enjoy every second of this gorgeous masterpiece. Do you guys think Blizzard could pull off a similar story of grit and heartache that appeals to a wide audience, but also gives Overwatch players some fan service throughout? And what do you guys think the Overwatch story would be about? I’d sorta hate for it to be just another telling of the Omnic crisis. I feel like it could be even more ambitious.

Hi loves! This past year, I have been building my Overwatch Drawn collection, and I'm happy to say that commissions are open again! If anyone is genuine about enquiring for an original artwork of their favourite character in this style, done by me, I'd be so grateful to hear from you🥰 my last customer was a delight to work with, let me know who you would like to see completed next! Have a beautiful day, gamer doods🤍✨️

For me is sojourn, I am 100% convince that 90% of the people playing her only because she's strong, if they neft her to be average, she will lose 90% of the player. I know this is not the most accurate of how many sojourn player there are, but after 3 years since she released, her subreddit r/SojournMains only has 1.6k members!!

I've seen a couple of people saying these skins are boring/uninteresting, but I personally love Overwatch's (the in-game organization) aesthetics, and the combination of white, black & orange look really good. I wish more heroes got skins like this in the future.

Me and friends like to get matching skins (full Talon team or full Junker team) and Null Sector would be cool but I can't find a second DPS with a matching skin.

Tank role has Orisa and Ramattra. Healers have Ana, Kiriko, and Zenyatta, and DPS has Bastion.... but who else?

I keep asking where's my Junkrat Bandicoot skin, but you can easily make a whole set out of it. Even back in 2016, this was all Activision, so not like you even have to make a deal with anyone. It's basically just one step above the Diablo or Warcraft collabs.

\- Junkrat is Crash, cause it's just perfect. He is the character, shoots Wumpa fruits out of his gun, uses Aku-Aku as tire and goes "Woah!" when he dies

\- Probably Kiriko would be Coco, cause they would need a suport to get a skin, and Kiriko is a skin magnet

\- Torb is Neo Cortex. He's small, has a big head and we all know he's never gonna get a collab skin

\- The redesigned Tawna from Crash 4 is just perfect for Junker Queen

\- I'd say Hog for Dingodile, but maybe you can make Winston work too

Hello fatmers (fat gamers). Today, i have decided to open my Maximilien’s Vault As one would do. The sight that i have been beared with Was not a pleasant one. You see; i expected skins for my Mains, mercy hog and ana, instead This is what pops up on my screen. I thought this skin was unavaible? I feel slightly coerced into getting it. Has this happened to anyone else?

2025-05-15 09:41:48,340 - INFO - Content: I feel Freja is another great hero... until it comes to her interactions with tanks
I feel like Freja is just another one of those instances where the devs design something without thinking of the collateral of said design.

Its clear they wanted Freja to be a high skill duelist zipping about and going for solo kills on squishies. Her gameplay feels super fun when doing so.

But her ability to just spam into the enemy tank for free value is crazy. She does *so* much damage. Her primary fire is so fast and so easy to spam that you can just unload a full clip into the tank before they have time to properly react. It's essentially just another Sojourn, 1 second and half of your HP is gone.

This is NOT me saying I don't think Freja is a good addition to the game. She's got a great skill ceiling and her gameplay when interacting with squishes is very satisfying. However, a bit like Mauga, sometimes the optimal playstyle is a complete contrast to the developer vision.

This might just be a skill issue, but been on both sides both being melted and seeing tanks get melted by this monster. Literally just spam your shots into the tank for easy value. It sucks.

2025-05-15 21:37:42,095 - INFO - Content: Baptiste is such a fun hero, its such a shame he isn't utilised more
Baptiste transitioned into 5v5 **very** well. The concept of Supports needing to contribute to damage and elims is literally what Baptiste is designed for, hence why he's always been a very viable pick throughout the entirety of OW2. Good burst heals plus a fight winning cooldown also gives him big playmaking capabilities without it feeling *too* bullshit (cough cough Ana). 

I just think it's such a shame Bap isn't utilised more by Blizzard in collabs and just in game in general. Bap should be the perfect support to learn for any new player trying out the role in OW2. Ok damage output, good heals, good utility. 

Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't Bap also decently popular? His gameplay is satisfying and simple enough to get the hang of, but he also has a high skill cieling, which makes him a solid pick for all ranks. Of course he'll never hit Mercy, Kiri, Juno popularity but I do see a good amount of Bap in my games, even when he's not meta like currently. 

He's also just a very cool hero in general! This was a bunch of waffle to essentially just say we need more Bap love, but we seriously do. He's pretty much the perfect support for 5v5.
