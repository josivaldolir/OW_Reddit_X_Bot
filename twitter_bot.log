Based on a match where only 1 teammate had Som as their 2nd vote or something and our Mercy didnâ€™t vote at all. So I (was on tank) told them at the start that they can deal with Som then, if there is 1. And then they proceeded to get FARMED by 1 all game

2025-06-02 03:08:14,198 - INFO - Content: How would you buff/change brig?
First off, I have yet to play stadium so this is standard mode talk(5v5). But I wanna say Brig is probably the most fun support to play for me. I have always loved defensive heavy builds but she needs a buff imo. Itâ€™s hard to enjoy her on a comp level as other supports are just much more dominate. Sheâ€™s in this weird no manâ€™s land where she is not really as useful as others in there categories. What I mean by this is she gets out healed by numerous other supports, she has a huge handicap for putting out damage/securing kills (have to be melee range/she also just doesnâ€™t hit hard in general), and finally her shield is super squishy while itâ€™s handy in certain situations you get melted very fast unless your whole team dives(and no Iâ€™m not on the frontline with her). I would like to see her have a buff defensively. What she could be good at is healing and just being able to survive but takes a hit offensively where her whip shot specifically doesnâ€™t do the same damage but maybe you can throw it out twice as often just for the sheer fact thatâ€™s your main way to proc inspire. Iâ€™d like to see maybe a hp buff or a shield hp buff at the very least. Possibly no on this and having her shield regen hp faster while also being in use would be acceptable instead of an hp buff(shield currently only regens when not in use). I would just like to see her used merely as a defensive fortification where you heal allies and mitigate damage with your shield but not being offensively dominant. All I know is currently sheâ€™s fun to play but lacks compared to others and needs changing imo. I get she was insanely overpowered back in the day. What changes would you give her that make her better while also maintaining balance?

I love the disability representation OW has.

I find Junker Queen, Roadhog and Juno debatable; not sure if the environments they come from render their bodies weaker or stronger.
