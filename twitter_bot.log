I’ve come to make an announcement: The Overwatch Dev Team’s a bitch-ass motherfucker, they pissed on my fucking wife! That’s right, they took their greedyfuckin’ blizzard dick out and they pissed on my fucking wife, and they said their widow buffs were “this big,” and I said “that’s disgusting,”

Recently went against a Freja that picked the power where she fires a mini ult every time she updrafts. She built full AP and CD... Our team couldn't even move. Honestly, I don't understand why they thought bringing the newest hero to the stadium was a good idea.

If anything the Classic mode shows how far we've come since the end of OW1's life, double sheild, Sombra hack that lasts 2 years, Bastion ,only 8 tanks is surprizing we've reached the level of fun we have now.

I really like sombra as a character mostly because of her personality but i really dislike her gameplay not because she is strong but rather because she is annoying and the fact that the majority of people playing her actually want to be a pain does not help.

99$ for Overwatch skins or $120 For basically 15 Full and Complete Street Fighter games. I'm not going to make any actual comments on my opinions of their marketing strategy lately.... but this honestly feels insane. And this is coming from someone who has spent countless $ on this game, both in copies of the game, loot boxes for me and friends, and skins/collabs purchased. More and more it goes from feeling like i'm supporting the game or supplementing my enjoyment through small purchases... to they trying to milk people as much as they can for as long as they can.
