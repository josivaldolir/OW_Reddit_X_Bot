2025-03-06 20:15:38,561 - INFO - Content: What is your unpopular opinions/hot takes?
Curious what other people's are tbh. 

My main one is that people hating/wanting nerfs for famously annoying characters (such as sym, torb, roadhog, junkrat etc) is reasonable. I can see characters that people find annoying taking all the fun out of the match for some people. (I personally don't have too many hated characters but they're mostly dive purely because I mainly play ana). 

Oh and that old dps passive was better. That reload and moment speed was so damn fun.

Edit: my other main one is that ow simply was never made for console. Having to pick between long range accuracy with a lowER sensitivity or being able to actually turn around while being jumped by a tracer, sombra, genji etc is insane.

I feel like the amount you get is insanely low, I’ve played over 60 games now and only have around 1500, I’ve also nearly finished the battle pass before I’ve even gotten a single gun skin.

There’s like 42 characters, I want to be able to get be able more than 3 of the weapon skins.. I understand that getting a lot of points from the  drives is a thing but I don’t like waiting that long to be able to get them.

I just don’t feel rewarded for actually playing comp when I’m mostly just playing it for the pretty guns.

Serious question. It takes months to years for things to be planned, developed, tested and implemented so how would it even be possible for them to create all this content in a matter of a few months. On top of that, are we going to pretend the last 2-3 years hasn't been constant upgrades, reworks, patches, balanced, new heroes, new maps, QoL changes, etc.?? Don't get me wrong I do believe there are some things OW2 brought in as a response to MR but it's no where near as much as a bunch of you claim. Lying to yourself to justify your hateboner is weird

I really enjoyed being able to vote on the player highlights after each match in the original Overwatch, but for some reason Overwatch 2 removed this fun feature. 

Does anyone else miss these post-match highlights too?

2025-03-07 13:00:23,196 - INFO - Content: In 7 years we will need to repeat mythic skins
Currently, there are 28 heroes without Mythic skins in the game. Every month and a half (one season), we get a new Mythic skin, and every three months (two seasons), we receive two Mythic skins and one new hero. If we keep up this pace (and the game still exists by then), in 7 years, all heroes in the game—including future ones—will have Mythic skins.

We just need to follow the example of the next season (a month and a half), where we will get one more Mythic skin, reducing the number needed by 1 (28 - 1 = 27). However, we will also receive a new hero, adding one more needed Mythic skin (27 + 1 = 28). Then, in the following season (three months in total), we will only receive a Mythic skin, reducing the number by 1 again (28 - 1 = 27).

So, every three months, we reduce the number of remaining heroes without Mythic skins by 1. Multiplying 3 months by 28 skins gives us 84 months, which, when divided by 12 months in a year, totals 7 years.

I randomly thought about this while playing and found it funny, so I thought it would be cool to share. Do you think the game will still exist by then?


Edit. It's actually about 9 years, not 7, each season has 60 days, not 45.

I'm still not entirely happy with her design (I think she looks generic asf) plus her abilities aren't very well thought out yet. 


But she is like my self insert character for a fiction I started writing a year ago and never finished lol. 


I hope to refine her design even more and make her believable, I love the ow art style so much 😔

The rules are that all ability cooldowns are in hours instead of seconds and you have to have an ability which has a cooldown. Also it is natural that with any ability that uses equipment you have that equipment (e.g. ana's biotic grenade). 

My friend and I have discussed this and he thinks moira's fade (6h cooldown) would be the best and meanwhile i prefer tracer's blinks bc they can stack.

Getting one heal on Zen is so hard, you have to just guess when to put the orb on someone, then pray to the heavens they don't take damage before it comes off.

WHY CANT ZEN TAKE OFF HIS HEALING ORB MANUALLY.

Anyways, my team wasn't very happy with me, lol

2025-03-08 09:35:47,384 - INFO - Content: I’ve tracked the last 1165 games I’ve played of Overwatch
My friends kept complaining they always got placed on Defense when joining a map. I got intrigued and wanted to see if that was true. That started a 15-month (and counting) project where I tracked which map I got and whether it was Attack or Defense.

As time went on, I started analyzing the data to find some interesting quirks:

* Of maps that existed the whole time during the collection phase, my least played map was Route 66, having only played it 28 times.
* In contrast, I’ve played Esperança and Suravasa 52 times each, almost twice as much.
* The most frequently repeated maps are the Clash maps (Hanaoka, Throne of Anubis), averaging 20 games between repetitions (of each specific map).
* I once went 155 maps between games of Paraíso.
* I once went to Runasapi back-to-back (in comp, no less).

And finally, I found an answer: we **did** get put on Defense more often than not. Not by much though (277/296 (48.34%/51.66%) Atk/Def). I’m no statistician, but that doesn’t seem as significant as they complained.

In any case, I thought this was cool and wanted to share. At this point, I’m invested and will probably keep tracking these data points, although it’s a headache when new maps are added.

I also added a skill linked to m2, it has a 4 second cooldown and works like Reinhardt's firestrake, but with critical damage

I gathered up all the derpy, cute sitting crochet babies I've made and took a little group picture to show them all off to everyone :D. 


If you're ever interested in adopting a crochet baby for yourself, check out my profile for a link that can help with that :D. Otherwise, I hope everyone gets a smile from the babies <3. 

Have a wonderful day!

2025-03-08 19:12:26,478 - INFO - Content: Solider 76 perks suck
His minor perks are very underwhelming 
Field emergency is basically useless 

Helix ammo return is a little better but why not just give him 10-15 more ammo like sojourn why does she get to have so much???

And don't get me started on his stim pack so many flaws first you have to press an extra button to use it
second it makes you unable to shoot or sprint third you are antied for four seconds you can't make this up...
His agility training is very good tho 

Now how can they improve them? simple if you ask me
Give him 10-15 ammo as i mentioned above.

Just remove critical restriction from field emergency and maybe bring it down to 70-80% speed.

As for his stim pack just remove the anti just do it and add an extra slot like zarya bubble where if you use either stim pack or biotic filed 
You can't use the other one so its much easier to use another button
