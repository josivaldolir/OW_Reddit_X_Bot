Based on a match where only 1 teammate had Som as their 2nd vote or something and our Mercy didn’t vote at all. So I (was on tank) told them at the start that they can deal with Som then, if there is 1. And then they proceeded to get FARMED by 1 all game

2025-06-02 03:08:14,198 - INFO - Content: How would you buff/change brig?
First off, I have yet to play stadium so this is standard mode talk(5v5). But I wanna say Brig is probably the most fun support to play for me. I have always loved defensive heavy builds but she needs a buff imo. It’s hard to enjoy her on a comp level as other supports are just much more dominate. She’s in this weird no man’s land where she is not really as useful as others in there categories. What I mean by this is she gets out healed by numerous other supports, she has a huge handicap for putting out damage/securing kills (have to be melee range/she also just doesn’t hit hard in general), and finally her shield is super squishy while it’s handy in certain situations you get melted very fast unless your whole team dives(and no I’m not on the frontline with her). I would like to see her have a buff defensively. What she could be good at is healing and just being able to survive but takes a hit offensively where her whip shot specifically doesn’t do the same damage but maybe you can throw it out twice as often just for the sheer fact that’s your main way to proc inspire. I’d like to see maybe a hp buff or a shield hp buff at the very least. Possibly no on this and having her shield regen hp faster while also being in use would be acceptable instead of an hp buff(shield currently only regens when not in use). I would just like to see her used merely as a defensive fortification where you heal allies and mitigate damage with your shield but not being offensively dominant. All I know is currently she’s fun to play but lacks compared to others and needs changing imo. I get she was insanely overpowered back in the day. What changes would you give her that make her better while also maintaining balance?

Needless to say, we were overrun and **LITERALLY** spawn locked. I was trying to pick their healers from the safety of the spawn room, but apparently dealing damage from inside it doesn’t count as being an active player…

2025-06-02 17:14:26,832 - INFO - Content: I asked all of the Overwatch Main Subs to rank their character's difficulty on a 1 to 5 scale. Here are the results.
Overall for the most part, I am pleasantly surprised with how this turned out. And it was really fun to read all of the responses from dedicated players. That being said, here are some quick things I just want to point out.

I did not specify rank - Anytime someone mentioned their rank, at the lowest end I saw platinum players voice themselves. The highest was from a few champions. I wanted to attempt to get a mixed bag of results.

I didn't include Cassidy and Sojourn on the graph because I honestly forgot to put them on. But I have their players rankings nonetheless. 

**Cassidy - 2.75**

**Sojourn - 2.25**

I'm sorry to anyone who got bombarded by my posts yesterday. I did not think people would end up seeing  ten+ different posts. And no, I was not karma farming. 

Personal Thoughts - What I did NOT expect was how Moira's mains ranked her. I expected a lot of them to say two or three, and explain proceed to explain that fade jumps are difficult or something. But all of them were straight up like "yeah she's easy lol." The two I did not expect to be so high up were Sombra and Hanzo. And I expected Freja to be higher, since the dev team literally stated she would be one of the hardest characters play on the roster. So that mindset was initially in many players heads. So I definitely did not expect to see her that low on the overall board. 

[My favorite response](https://www.reddit.com/r/JunkRatMains/comments/1l0zzdl/how_would_you_rank_junkrats_difficulty_on_a_1_to/) was in JunkratMains, and the top comment has convinced me that Junkrat is one of the best designed characters in the game now lol.

2025-06-02 19:12:08,314 - INFO - Content: I asked all of the Overwatch Main Subs to rank their character's difficulty on a 1 to 5 scale. Here are the results.
Overall for the most part, I am pleasantly surprised with how this turned out. And it was really fun to read all of the responses from dedicated players. That being said, here are some quick things I just want to point out.

I did not specify rank - Anytime someone mentioned their rank, at the lowest end I saw platinum players voice themselves. The highest was from a few champions. I wanted to attempt to get a mixed bag of results.

I didn't include Cassidy and Sojourn on the graph because I honestly forgot to put them on. But I have their players rankings nonetheless. 

**Cassidy - 2.75**

**Sojourn - 2.25**

I'm sorry to anyone who got bombarded by my posts yesterday. I did not think people would end up seeing  ten+ different posts. And no, I was not karma farming. 

Personal Thoughts - What I did NOT expect was how Moira's mains ranked her. I expected a lot of them to say two or three, and explain proceed to explain that fade jumps are difficult or something. But all of them were straight up like "yeah she's easy lol." The two I did not expect to be so high up were Sombra and Hanzo. And I expected Freja to be higher, since the dev team literally stated she would be one of the hardest characters play on the roster. So that mindset was initially in many players heads. So I definitely did not expect to see her that low on the overall board. 

[My favorite response](https://www.reddit.com/r/JunkRatMains/comments/1l0zzdl/how_would_you_rank_junkrats_difficulty_on_a_1_to/) was in JunkratMains, and the top comment has convinced me that Junkrat is one of the best designed characters in the game now lol.

2025-06-02 20:46:50,700 - INFO - Content: The grammar of this pisses me off almost as much as the fact that someone left.
There should be a comma after "leaving" so that it reads:

>Due to a player leaving, this competitive match...

The way it's currently worded, it looks like "this competitive match" is connected to "due to a player leaving," not "will shutdown in 10 seconds." That is, it looks like it's saying this:

>Due to a player leaving this competitive match ***it*** will shutdown in 10 seconds."

But there's no "it," so the flow is weird. And honestly, that one could even do with a comma after "match."

Not to mention that "shutdown" is a noun (like, "we beat them so hard that it was a shutdown!"), but it's operating as a verb in that sentence. It should be two words: "shut down."

Please fix this, Blizzard, for it hurts my English major soul.

2025-06-03 08:22:57,791 - INFO - Content: Kiriko and Hanzo now have an unique ultimate voiceline for their mythics.
Well I'm saying now, but maybe it was implemented in an earlier patch and no one really noticed.

Kiriko says "Let my sunlight guide you"

And Hanzo says....well he says something different, most likely "Let vengeance consume you" in japanese.

So Ashe is the only hero left that still uses the regular ultimate voice line for her mythic. (While your allies do hear something unique, being "Destroy them, BOB !", the one playing Ashe still hears the regular ultimate voice line)

2025-06-03 12:32:22,346 - INFO - Content: Overwatch is fun for me again
I went through phases of being really into ow1, but after ow2 came out the game just wasn’t fun for me anymore and I didn’t play it much at all

I returned recently to try it out and the changes that they’ve made have gotten me addicted again so it’s good to see this game is going in the right direction

1. Free hero unlocks are very important and I’m glad they realized this. I don’t want to spend tons of time doing stupid challenges to unlock heroes

2. Regenerating health: this is something that I’ve always wished overwatch had and found it frustrating to not be in the game so another major improvement for me

3. Hero bans in ranked: good addition that is very standard in ranked modes for most games

4. Dps anti heal: another downside  of ow was that the ttk could feel way too long because healing is strong so having some anti heal is definitely a good thing, otherwise you just feel like your damage is absolutely pointless 

5. Perks: at first i didn’t think I would like perks but now I think they’re pretty good, offers some more variety and playstyle choice

6. Stadium: seems like a solid concept and definitely good that they added something to give us a new experience, only played 1 game of this so far I’ve just been playing ranked

I would like to say good job to the developers for making this game fun again with some smart changes and decisions

So, out of all the bad shit that has happened with Blizzard and how bad they can be, it is genuinely awesome that Overwatch is a very loudly pro queer game. That the face of OW1 was a lesbian, or that Soldier, the most 'Call of Duty' character in this game is gay and the CoD players will just have to accept it, is a nice thing about this game, to giving us plenty of pride makers/icons/player backgrounds (i forget what they are called, the long rectangle image that goes next to your name in a comp match)

I really want to give props to this, because the only other multiplayer game that I play frequently is Helldivers 2, and unfortunatly Arrowhead - the developers of that game - have shown themselves to be a huge pussy because they won't put a pride flag on because they're scared their homophobic players will stop playing the game.

It's going to get more and more common for big IPs to tone down on the gay representation in the coming years because the three most powerful governments in the world all fucking hate queers, so I hope OW stays the course.

Happy Pride!

At first I was like “okay, maybe they’re friends with the same usernames, not out of the ordinary.”

NOPE. Turns out this guy is running TWO XBOXS TO PLAY FUCKING OVERWATCH.

Now you may say, “oh, you don’t know that they’re the same person.” 

It was so deadly clear they were the same. 

He would play Ashe first, hide Cassidy in a corner, and then whenever Ashe died, he’d pick up on Cassidy. 

The worst part is, it was stadium.

 No, that wasn’t THE WORST PART. the whole time our tank and other support were complaining that Cassidy sucked. HMMM I WONDER WHY?

Then our rein started to be toxic saying “gg no team” after we lost THE VERY FIRST ROUND. HMM I WONDER TF WHY

we did eventually turn it around, ended the game off at 3-4. We could’ve won if that one person didn’t decide to play two different characters.

I reported them on Overwatch and Xbox. 
Doubtful anything will happen on Xbox, but I’m praying something happens on OW.

While watching a replay I was flabbergasted by how far her biotic grasp can reach. Am I just too noob or is this really kinda messed up? I read online that it can reach up to 20m, which is crazy to me

This tier list is me ranking how interested I’d be watching a cinematic based off on the character. My rationale for the ranking is if this character has a lot of lore that needs to be explored, or just needs some time in the light, the higher the ranking. The lower the ranking, either I believe their lore has been explored enough via mini comics and short stories, narratively not worth expanding upon in a cinematic, or I think their character is just flat-out disinteresting. 

I know some characters introduced in Overwatch 2 (Not the new launch heroes) have already technically been represented in an animated short, but let’s just put on our thinking caps for a second an have some fun!

2025-06-04 20:14:08,811 - INFO - Content: Why are some people so obsessed with whether or not a hero takes skill?
I see it quite a bit in game, people go off on each other about playing characters that take "no skill" or "less skill" than the character they are playing. They died to a Junkrat as Sojourn? Well, he's no skill, so....

It seems like they only think characters you have to aim with require skill. Ashe, Cassidy, Widowmaker, Sojourn, Tracer, Ana, Bap, etc.

I think these people forgot that this is a video game and we are supposed to be having fun. It's okay to dislike a character, but when it extends to harassing their players, that's a bit TOO far.

Hey every one!, i made this fan art based on the new concept of Widowmaker with Cammy, I'm not sure if we should say Widowmaker cosplaying Cammy, or Cammy cosplaying Widowmaker, but either way, i love Widowmaker and i find Cammy a very interesting character designed, so i def wanted to make a fan art of her.

I’m genuinely so sick of whiny teammates crying about one team having more or less heal stats than the other as if that’s our only job.

zen is not going to have the same healing as lifeweaver or mercy 

moira is going to have high damage because that’s how she refills her resource 

ana isn’t going to use her nade just to heal you, it’s there to also disable the other teams healing 

THINK before you start crying

So I killed the Junkrat and waiting for the Mercy to go in for a rez, but she did this tech where she jumps a bit further onto the bus and rez him where I can't even reach. 

When I play Mercy and rez someone and move a bit further than their death spot, I got cancelled right away. This distance feels very illegal. It's funny how the Mercy actually pinged me in the replay and her teammates are oblivious.

I’m genuinely so sick of whiny teammates crying about one team having more or less heal stats than the other as if that’s our only job.

zen is not going to have the same healing as lifeweaver or mercy 

moira is going to have high damage because that’s how she refills her resource 

ana isn’t going to use her nade just to heal you, it’s there to also disable the other teams healing 

THINK before you start crying

To the tank who threw;  
Genuinely, and from the bottom of my heart - **Thank you.**

It's 1am for me.  
Tonight's been the first night I've been able to play comp' since I had my baby and I had to stay up late to do so, my husband said he'd comfort our wee one if he woke up crying.  
  
Halfway into the first round of a comp game, my son starts crying and my husband goes off to soothe him but is clearly struggling - End of the first round I ask in match chat if it's okay if we make round 2 a quick one as my husband's struggling to get wee one back to bed, I don't care if it's a win or a loss as long as it's quick.

Enemy Winton, to the great upset of his Ana basically threw the round and the whole game as our team had won the first round to let me relieve my husband of duty and get back to my son. 

I couldn't let this good deed go unnoticed before heading off to bed.  
So again, to the tank who threw...   
**Thank you.**

2025-06-07 04:44:14,949 - INFO - Content: What's something that took you an embarrassingly long time to figure out or realize?
Overwatch is a pretty complex game. I played a ton of OW1, but didn't play much after the implementation of the role queue. Then, I installed it again this month and wow I'm hooked like I was 6-7 years ago in large part due to Stadium. I decided to gun for the challenge which requires you to win one game with every hero. I'm an Ana/support main, played a decent amount of all of them except Illari and Juno which I hadn't touch at all before.

Back to Stadium, I really struggled with Juno to get that "W" which surprises me because her kit seemed pretty nice and I main supports in general. I was going full on torpedo build after reading some tier lists mentioning it as the clear W, yet my healing output was fairly low, I would only sometimes out heal Anas or Lucios. Then, comes yesterday evening. While playing Stadium on Junker Queen, I was alone pushing the cart with Juno after winning a close team fight, and then I realized that she was shooting at me and... healing me. 

So I now want to take a moment to apologize to all these stadium teammates I watched die in front of me because I had torpedo on cooldown. To all these teammates who watched me choosing to try to snipe an Ashe instead of healing them, I'm sorry.

Literally every single game has an Ana in it, I can't escape the devil grandma. Sleep + Nade is my sleep paralysis demon. Sometimes I just wanna be able to play the the game without the mental fatigue of not being able to play the game every 16 seconds lol.

Real talk I don't know how Ana is even fun anymore for the Ana mains. Surely sleep + nade the enemy tank on cooldown is boring as heck.

(Also real talk Ana isn't that difficult of a hero anymore and the fact her own mains rated her a 4/5 for difficulty is funny)

Literally every single game has an Ana in it, I can't escape the devil grandma. Sleep + Nade is my sleep paralysis demon. Sometimes I just wanna be able to play the the game without the mental fatigue of not being able to play the game every 16 seconds lol.

Real talk I don't know how Ana is even fun anymore for the Ana mains. Surely sleep + nade the enemy tank on cooldown is boring as heck.

(Also real talk Ana isn't that difficult of a hero anymore and the fact her own mains rated her a 4/5 for difficulty is funny)

I wanted to make some extra Vengeance options that suit my tastes a bit more! For the colour palettes I have Ultraviolet, Corrosive Love, and Silver Rose! For the hairstyles I went with a hime cut, ponytail, and bixie, I hope you’ll like my concepts!

I really liked Mercy's new skin and wanted to make something similar for Juno. I took a lot of inspiration from medieval fashion so she's not as modern looking compared to Mercy's, which i think is fine.

2025-06-07 09:37:49,975 - INFO - Content: What the hell is QP 6v6 even about?
Okay so I was trying to do some warm ups for comp matches okay? Figure “let me go 6v6 can’t hurt” but it hurt. It hurt so bad i chose support and what happens? I have to take custody of 5 DPS. Mind you nobody said anything in the match JUST ME. now I’m not complaining but I kid you not, we won the match. And I am speechless 3 to almost 4 years of playing Overwatch 2 (yes 2) I never expected this. Makes me really feel the pain for the support mains.
