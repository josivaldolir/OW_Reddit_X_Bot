2025-03-09 10:38:33,713 - INFO - Content: Where am I supposed to practice if not Quick Play?
The past couple days I've been working on practicing Symmetra. I adored her in OW1 but her new playstyle since the rework has never really clicked with me. 

I don't really have any DPS characters I play well, so I've been trying to practice Symm to just get a feel of how she works and try to really put in the effort to learn her new kit. 

Admittedly, it hasn't been going great. I do struggle a lot. I die a lot. I don't always deal the most damage. I don't always get the most value. There's a lot to consider with her kit and it's more than I'm used to.

I've been getting flamed by teammates and even opponents. Today in a game the enemy tank kept saying how I may as well have been helping his team win, and my team was joining in saying how awful I had been playing.

It was Quick Play, though. Where else am I supposed to practice a hero if not in Quick Play? Am I doing something wrong by playing subpar in that mode?

When is the mid season patch so they can put that old man in his grave. Like my team will be winning and then boom Torb. Itâ€™s no more point for us. 300-400 heath. Turret that hits like a truckâ€¦ that also has the dps passive for whatever fucking reason. He has no fall off. His damage is crazy. The perk being able to put his turret on a wall was the biggest mistake they possibly couldâ€™ve done. Itâ€™s just like the Illari situation but with damage. Iâ€™m just wondering why no one is talking about how annoying it is to play against him.

2025-03-09 16:13:33,812 - INFO - Content: We put our differences aside for a group photo because the game wouldnâ€™t give us a second support in QP
Started a quickplay match yesterday and almost immediately saw one of the other teamâ€™s support players leave the match. Then the game just kindaâ€¦didnâ€™t give them a replacement.

Iâ€™ve seen this happen a few times recently, and it looks like itâ€™s a bug. Felt pretty unfair to keep at it as a 5v4, so we all took the opportunity to take a group photo. Watching everyone organize for the pic in text chat was great.

See, OW2 isnâ€™t toxic ALL the time!

Photo credit goes to the other teamâ€™s Sombra, King!
