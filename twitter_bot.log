With Wuayng‚Äôs hero trial coming up in the next seasom, are there any hopes you all have for his possible kit?

Personally, I think it would be really cool if he‚Äôs another melee healer like Brig, mostly because I love the bo staff as a weapon and his outfit kinda gives me martial artist vibes.

Also, I really hope he has a cleanse somewhere in his base kit (no perk necessary) since it just makes sense for a water-based hero to have a cleanse imo. Plus, it would allow for another anti-heal counter in case Kiriko gets banned!

This beast took me a bit to make, but I can finally say I'm done with her, Ashe's Viper. The bullets in the pouch can be taken out and put back in, and the lever has a little bit of self lever action thanks to the addition of magnets on the gun and the lever. 

I hope you all have a wonderful day! Thank you so much for taking the time to check out my creation!

2025-06-20 19:12:31,051 - INFO - Content: How did Overwatch manage to make a game where Damage is the least popular role?
I'm not even hating. It's genuinely a historical gaming anomaly to see the damage dealing role be the least popular of the big three archetypes.

Remember that the swap to 5v5 was because tank was the least popular role, and the bad ratio of players in the queues was leading to long wait-times for players of more popular roles. At the time, people argued that this might be unavoidable because it's just how it works in every game. Be it, MMOs, MOBAs, heck, even table-tops, it's always the same; everyone wants to be the star, the play-maker, the one on the kill feed, the one that makes the biggest number appear above the monster's head. This has been an issue since role-based games first came into existence, and every single game deals with it so we figured it was just human psychology.

So you just gotta ask: **How?**

It honestly deserves to be studied. How in the world did Overwatch turn gaming on its head and make SUPPORT the most popular role, and tank more popular than DPS? That is just wild to me.

Just played a match where Mercy got banned, and in response, a Mercy main and her boyfriend duo both decided to have a date in the corner of the map for the entire match instead of actually playing the game. 

I have a feeling that this isn‚Äôt exactly a rare occurrence (especially with a character that has as many one-tricks as Mercy) but regardless, these people should receive punishment from Blizzard as they are actively ruining the game for everyone.

For me, I compulsively hit reload. It's completely mechanical and has cost me so many times. I tried key binding it out of reach and my lizard brain learned to stretch for it. I got rid of it all together and that was even worse. I'm resigned to being a reloader.

What's your Achilles heel?

I am not the first and definitely am not the last who will continue to struggle in Drives as a Solo-Que. I been playing since 2017 so save me the whole "look inward and summon your Overwatch spirit animal to correct your team and win" ........Trust me there is NOTHING I do can help some of these individuals I am paired with...

 These matches come down to everyone doing their best at what they pick and it should not be anyone's sole duty to carry everyone. Also Solo-Que should never be paired against stacks. It's just a trolling system that embellishes stacks with ez wins and a golden road to all rewards. Most of the times you see a Solo-Que mention how terrible the matchmaking is, there is always someone with a dedicated stack or team who tells everyone how bad they are and should be better. Trust me, nothing some of us Solo-Que players can save the game when you have players who absolutely do not try and are just there for "funsies".

2025-06-22 15:39:31,098 - INFO - Content: I feel like Freja is just a better Echo
Her M1 is more accurate at range, does more against armor due to being larger dmg per projectile, Echos M1 is likley only to do headshot damage on one of the projectiles instead of all 3 unless youre point blank.

Frejas M2 is just straight up better sticky bombs. Theyre faster, way shorter cooldown, kills a squishy in 2 quick sticks with a single dash. Makes tanks lives hell. Peek a corner and stick any 250hp character twice in less than a second then vanish. Echo also probably wont be hitting 100% of her sticky volley unless shes close.

Frejas movement makes it much harder to hit her than it does with echo since echo is fairly large and has very slippery/slidey movement outside of her initial dash with flight.

Echo does have her E beam which can finish off high hp targets, but freja can do it from further range just spamming take aim shots.

In most cases it feels like freja just does what echo does, from any range, with much less risk. Echo is a glass cannon who is annihilated by any half decent hitscan while freja is a gnat that can 2 tap you while being significantly harder to hit.

2025-06-22 21:13:44,744 - INFO - Content: I feel like Freja is just a better Echo
Her M1 is more accurate at range, does more against armor due to being larger dmg per projectile, Echos M1 is likley only to do headshot damage on one of the projectiles instead of all 3 unless youre point blank.

Frejas M2 is just straight up better sticky bombs. Theyre faster, way shorter cooldown, kills a squishy in 2 quick sticks with a single dash. Makes tanks lives hell. Peek a corner and stick any 250hp character twice in less than a second then vanish. Echo also probably wont be hitting 100% of her sticky volley unless shes close.

Frejas movement makes it much harder to hit her than it does with echo since echo is fairly large and has very slippery/slidey movement outside of her initial dash with flight.

Echo does have her E beam which can finish off high hp targets, but freja can do it from further range just spamming take aim shots.

In most cases it feels like freja just does what echo does, from any range, with much less risk. Echo is a glass cannon who is annihilated by any half decent hitscan while freja is a gnat that can 2 tap you while being significantly harder to hit.

My skill rating (SR) took a nose dive after the drives started. Was trying to grind for Diamond during the Drive, but that's not going to happen now, haha. 5v5 hasn't been much better, unfortunately. How's your experience been so far?

2025-06-23 21:15:21,429 - INFO - Content: StadiumBuilds.io by the Numbers: What You Built in Season 16 (and a lil' teaser)
Hey everyone, Austin here (aka Nomabond). The last month has been wild, so I wanted to share what‚Äôs new, what‚Äôs improved, and what‚Äôs coming next on [**StadiumBuilds.io**](https://stadiumbuilds.io).

Let‚Äôs get into it üëá

# üèÜ Season 16 Rewind is Live!

I just dropped our **first ever season wrap-up**:

üîó [**https://stadiumbuilds.io/season16-rewind**](https://stadiumbuilds.io/season16-rewind)

* **3,475 builds** from 1,931 builders
* **25,278 likes** across the site
* Over **2.2 million views**
* Top builds, hero usage charts, and more
* Log in to see **your** personal stats

This will be a regular thing now as a little seasonal celebration of the chaos you all cook up.

# üìä Brand New: Live Meta Analytics

Want to see how Stadium Mode evolved week-by-week?

üîó [**https://stadiumbuilds.io/insights**](https://stadiumbuilds.io/insights) (login required)

We now track:

* **Most used items and heroes**
* Stat shifts and meta swings
* Everything rendered live from the DB, no smoke, no mirrors

Whether you theorycraft or just like to nerd out on trends, this page is for you.

# üõ†Ô∏è Quality of Life & UX Overhauls

* **New Home Page** with live stats + smoother navigation
* Hero picker redesign
* Optional Powers finally behave
* Average round price filtering + better filters overall
* **Comment threading** is fixed + cleaner replies
* Round notes now support **images**, **GIFs**, **YouTube links**, and up to **10,000 characters**
* Unsaved changes modal so you don‚Äôt lose your thoughts mid-round
* Profanity filtering on pronouns.. üò¨ (you know who you are)

# üöÄ Site Performance Got a Massive Buff

* Redis-powered view tracking (way faster, way more accurate)
* CDN + cache invalidation overhaul = fewer janky loads
* Fixed re-render bugs, reduced layout shift, squashed a ton of weird edge cases

# üí¨ Supporter Features (and a Sneak Peek)

* Dedicated [**Supporters Page**](https://stadiumbuilds.io/supporters)
* Patch Notes tab
* üéÅ Supporter-only build & profile flair, custom site themes, new layouts, profile perks, permalinks 

>I've been quietly working on a \*\*real-time enhancement\*\* to how you interact with builds. Think less alt-tabbing, more time focused on winning. :)   
  
You're going to love it!

This project started as something I built for my wife and now we‚Äôre getting thousands of players every week. Thank you for the support, the memes, the builds, and the chaos. Seriously.

As always: feedback, bug reports, hype, and memes welcome in the replies or in the Discord!

Keep building friends,  
**‚Äì Nomabond**

2025-06-23 22:43:02,931 - INFO - Content: Character silhouettes revealed back in 2020
Back in 2020 before overwatch 2 released, blizzard revealed 4 silhouettes of some of the upcoming heroes concept art. We know that the third one with the big ninja star is Kiriko and I‚Äôm pretty sure that the one with the wizard staff is Ramattra. But what about the others? If I had to guess I‚Äôd say the one on the left is maybe Sojourn? But on the right I‚Äôve got no idea (maybe Lifeweaver without the flower on his back but that‚Äôs a bit of a stretch) What do you all think? And has blizzard ever show us the original photos of these silhouettes?

I just redownloaded the game like 5 or six days ago and was barely able to complete the BP and all for free too. I already had 400 coins so I was able to unlock it by getting to the end. Normally I wouldn‚Äôt have subjected myself to this but the next BP looks WAYYY lamer and I didn‚Äôt want to miss out on some of the things I actually wanted in this one compared to the next one where I don‚Äôt like a single one of the skins. I did somewhere between 20-30 levels in the past 24 hours, I never want to touch stadium again and I NEED to touch some grass.

Also left with a flat 69 coins lol

I see nobody brings this up, so I decided to bring it here for visibility. 

Kiriko has been an iconic part of Overwatch 2 and these fox videos helped me pass the days of corona lockdown. So sad that this happened.

2025-06-24 18:22:00,284 - INFO - Content: Realistic Hollywood Casting
If we want the Overwatch movie to REALLY HAPPEN, we gotta get serious about our casting choices. No actors who fit or deserve the role, I want funny guy with name I remember. If we get this right, I‚Äôm thinking we can get at least 26% on rotten tomatoes. So who else are we casting?

(Thanks to u/R3MIX_19 for casting Chris Pratt as Wrecking Ball)

2025-06-25 21:15:44,368 - INFO - Content: Thoughts on recent mythics being more upgrade based than customizable?
With dva‚Äôs new mythic being out, just want to know yalls thought on how more recent mythics are more focused on being upgradable rather than having more customization options. I think it has to do with the mythic shop being the way you earn the skin rather than directly from the battlepass cause ever since reaper in season 12 came out all the ones after have been upgrade based. 

I personally think the recent final upgraded mythics look better opposed to the earlier ones that have more options, but I also feel like the main point of mythics is having options to change things like weapons or headpieces or masks or armor parts, not just straight up full armor upgrades + one other changeable aspect. I think the best of both would just be making the final total armor tier be the base skin then having extra alternatives for armor and weapons like how sigma or jq have.

What do you think? 

I honestly liked, will get Snake Eyes and Scarlet for sure

I am outraged by this absolute crater of an oversight in detail by the Overwatch team.
In protest I will just heal as Mercy and provide no additional damage in retaliation to Blizzards lack of due diligence.

The idea came from the urge to make a mercy skin that could really match her Dokiwatch weapon, and as soon as I saw the rainbows in her pistol I knew: She had to be the Heart of Pride!

I tried to combine clouds, stars, hearts, rainbows and angel features all at once, so maybe it‚Äôs a little too much! Hahah

There‚Äôs also an info I forgot to add: this is her Valkyrie version, the regular version does not have the giant wings and the behind rainbow bow, but that‚Äôs about it! 

Anyways, I had so much fun designing this! The coloring gave me a little bit of a headache cus of all the rainbows, but I think I figured it out. 

Hope y‚Äôall like it! <3

2025-06-26 10:45:20,612 - INFO - Content: So many great skins in this game are unobtainable
I can't be the only one starting to get a little bothered by how heavily Blizzard are leverging fomo lately. Collabs have been back to back, and none of them have ever returned. Old OWL skins have never returned. Past battle pass skins have almost never returned.

I've never seen another game have to leverage fomo like this. Even Fortnite brought back some of their rarest skins in the game. Their collab skins almost always come back as well.

# 1. The ‚ÄúMiss It and It‚Äôs Gone Forever‚Äù Mentality

We‚Äôve gone from a lootbox system in OW1 (flawed, yes, but at least democratic) to a structure where 90% of skins are time-gated, rarely return, and are locked behind *high* paywalls. Bought a battle pass and missed a few levels? Too bad. Wanted that collab skin but didn‚Äôt hear about it in time? Wait another year‚Äîor never.

Blizzard is banking on urgency, and it‚Äôs exhausting. Skins aren‚Äôt just cosmetic anymore‚Äîthey're psychological traps. You‚Äôre pushed to buy *now* or risk never seeing them again. This isn‚Äôt just unhealthy for players‚Äîit‚Äôs short-sighted for the game‚Äôs longevity.

# 2. Collabs Have Become Predatory

Almost every one of these collabs feel like time-limited cash grabs. No reruns. No ways to earn through gameplay. Just ‚Äúbuy now or lose it forever.‚Äù

Where other games (*Fortnite*, *League*, *Valorant*) have started offering rotating shops and chances to catch up, Blizzard doubles down on artificial scarcity.

# 3. Battle Pass Exclusivity Feels Punitive

Yes, the new Mythic Shop in Season 10 is a **step** in the right direction, but it still only lets you get *mythics*, and only if you‚Äôre currently active. Legendary and Epic BP skins? Still locked. Even ones from *Season 1*. There‚Äôs no comprehensive vault, no legacy shop, no way to earn or even buy missed skins. It‚Äôs "you had to be there," over and over again.

# 4. The Shop Is Just Bad

Skins cycle in and out seemingly at random, and there‚Äôs no predictability or transparency. There‚Äôs no wishlist, no return calendar, no event archive. You either check the store constantly or miss out. Why can‚Äôt I just buy what I want, when I want?

Worse, prices are still way too high. $19 for a skin that was previously unlockable via lootbox? $5 for a souvenir no one uses?

# What Blizzard Should Do (IMO):

* Open a **Legacy Shop**: Let players buy old BP and collab skins (on a rotation that suits whatever deal they made with the brand of the collab. Same as Fortnite does) with Overwatch Coins or Mythic Prisms.
* Add a **skin wishlist system** and transparent **return rotation**.

They added sigma to stadium and one of his powers is maestro which charges his ultimate 50% faster but reduces the radius by 50%. The ultimate is tiny and very hard to hit. This is because reducing the radius of a circle by 50% reduces the area by 75% (area = pi *r^2). I think it would be much more balanced if the area was reduced by 50% instead of the radius. This would be a 30% reduction in radius instead of what it is now.

2025-06-27 12:33:16,749 - INFO - Content: Why do people overlook Hazard for not getting new skins?
From Hazard's release (Season 14) till now, Hazard has 1 Legendary (Mobster) & 1 Epic (Bixi) skin.

From Freja's release (Season 16) till now, Freja eventually has 2 Legendary skins (Heart of Courage & Scarlett).

Many people (including me) were wishing for a Scottish character and we finally have one, but how come most people ignore him for not getting new skins?

It says that if players vote "overwhelmingly" for one map, then it is automatically chosen. But there have been so many images where 11/12 votes have gone to one map and 1/12 has gone to another, but the 1/12 map was randomly selected. Is this a feature that was mistakenly left out of this update?

2025-06-28 15:15:23,242 - INFO - Content: Long-Time Bayonetta Appreciator Here With a Collab Idea (Or Two)
This is just for fun and was thrown together really quickly/haphazardly, but I think I cooked for sure lol. Tracer being Bayonetta instead of Widowmaker was very intentional btw. Lmk what y'all think!

I chose to use the Bayonetta 2 designs because they fit the best with the Overwatch heroes I've chosen for this (dream) collab but also because OW2 being Switch-compatible means that the Bayonetta 2 designs can bypass Nintendo's obsession with exclusivity and finally appear in another crossover (only the original Bayonetta ever appears in crossovers due to IP / trademarking logistics I'd rather not get into).

  
Also, because this is all a hypothetical, I would like to imagine all four of these skins would be Legendary tier skins that each have additional cosmetics. Tracer and Widowmaker could both have victory poses based off of Bayonetta and Jeanne's Lock On stances or something... some sprays here, a Cheshire weapon charm there and voice lines referencing taunts or Chapter Clear voice lines. Idk something to really make their bundle prices any less painful to stomach!

I really enjoy push as a game mode. To me it‚Äôs dynamic and the back and forth is great for creating tension in close games

A good push game is some of the most fun ive ever had in overwatch

But when map voting happens, people very rarely vote for push I‚Äôm usually the one one. And I don‚Äôt understand why

2025-06-29 01:24:17,660 - INFO - Content: You guys aren't respecting how glacially slow it is to climb if you're just above a 50% win rate
Let's say you're at a 55% win rate. That's pretty respectable. You're definitely going to climb up the ranks with that. But that means for every one-hundred games you play. 100! You're only winning 5 more games than someone who's breaking even. 
 
It takes 5 wins just to break into a new division. So that means you're climbing up one division every one-hundred games played. 

Let's go lower. Say you're eeking out a 52% win rate. You're climbing! You are winning *two* more games **per 100 games played**, than your peers. 

At 5 wins per division. 5 divisions per rank. You're looking at *625 games* to rank up a single rank!! How many games did you play last season? How many have you played over the course of the last 4 seasons?

Keep up the grind. It's a crazy time sink that most people don't realize. 

*Edit* many of you seem to think I'm advocating for something. Some type of change or an unmet expectation. I'm not. I'm giving you a glimpse into the amount of time it takes (roughly) for your wins to stack. There's no deeper meaning. You don't have to argue that "it's supposed to be that way!" No one is saying it shouldn't be that way. There's no agenda or call to action.

Hi everyone.   
  
I made a quick little mock-up to illustrate the idea. I personally find it really unintuitive that your build icons on the left can be of the same color, even when they \_all\_ belong to different categories. If half of your items are rare - they will all be light-blue, no matter what category - weapon, ability or survival - they belong to, same for all other rarities. I think when each category has its own color palette, it makes it possible to get the idea of your build at a glance, which is a significant improvement to readability in my opinion. 

But what do you think?

2025-06-30 15:43:19,844 - INFO - Content: Clickbait. Bastion is literally shortest hero in the game in Tank form now
Pictures are taken from Marblr video on YouTube. So, Bastion's size before the S17 patch

Maybe offtop. I was surprised during long time (in days of OW1 mostly) why people was saying "Torbjorn is shortest hero in the game" while Bastion in tank form literally was the real dwarf. Yes, I know that is the specific condition, but nobody just even didn't mention it. Seems like Bastion was forgotten

Yellow lines indicate the level of the camera, the green dot is the center of this intersection, the place where the camera is located.

Due to the great length of the tank Bastion, it appears that the tracks are not level with Torbjorn's legs. But heights are quite accurate.

Camera level for Torbjorn ‚Äì 1m
Camera level for tank Bastion (tank) ‚Äì 1.02m

However, after patch S17, the Bastion Tank camera level should be: 0.92m due to a 10% model decreasing and tank model should become for 0.7 cells lower. Roughly calculating, the height of the top of Torbjorn's head is 6.5 cells on the picture. The Bastion had 7 cells, became 6.3 cells.
If the tank configuration returns, Bastion will become one of the shortest heroes in all respects
 
How likely is it that Tank Configuration will return?

I don't mean to stereotype an entire player base of people that play mercy, but why is it from my experience anytime I meet a mercy player in-game, there's a high chance they'll either be toxic, won't heal you, or they're a stubborn one trick and god forbid you take their character from them. Because they don't know how to play anything else apparently.

2025-07-01 23:15:24,637 - INFO - Content: So we‚Äôre just never getting a free collab skin again right? Just 60$ packages?
I think the last free collab skin we got was Katara Mei, but I guess before that I cant remember one other than Mumen Rider Soldier 76. I guess I‚Äôm just confused because we‚Äôre getting collabs with up to 8 skins (Street Fighter) and not getting any free when there was only 4 skins in the One Punch Man collab and we still got a free one.

2025-07-01 23:39:38,934 - INFO - Content: Blizzard Misleads Console Players, Then Covers It Up
This Season's Starter Pack  initially released on consoles with a listed bonus of 20 Battle Pass tier skips. I bought it, didn‚Äôt get any skips.

Contacted support, got copy-paste replies, they just told me it's being looked into and asked me to wait.

A few days later they quietly changed the store image. No more tier skips listed.

It‚Äôs been a week. I‚Äôm still getting automated responses, and now they‚Äôre saying the pack doesn‚Äôt include the 20 tier skips at all. Still no official statement from Blizzard.

If you bought the pack on console in the first day or two, I suggest you reach out and ask for your bp skips. Otherwise they will probably just ignore it.

I couldnt find any links for playstation (your email invoice can be used as proof) but here are the archive links for xbox:

Just went against this pathetic Mercy, Lucio combo in stadium and the mercy admitted to ximming in chat and it was just completely obvious and the most anti-fun shit ive ever seen. Is it a giant problem in console overwatch? I'm plat 2 but im kind of trash at the game and it seems like if you play fair you can only go so far on console without this constantly happening. Is this an actual issue that blizzard is aware of?
