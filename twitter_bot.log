It's always ''doom switch''. If my DPS are both doing really poorly and dying too much, it's only because they have no shield tank apparently. I got called the r word and a ''doom bot'' because I didn't switch to Zarya at a random's request. And also that I should switch because with Doom we have ''3 dps''. I legit enjoy the character and want to win but this is getting ridiculous.

2025-03-03 21:13:40,973 - INFO - Content: Overwatch doesn‚Äôt do enough to stop downrankers/smurfs
For reference, I‚Äôm gold. Im pretty comfortable with the idea that I suck, but I play to have fun, so whatever.

I just got out of a match with a fairly obvious Smurf account in a 5 stack who spent the match on sojourn with a mercy pocket and absolutely annihilated my entire team over and over. By the end of the game, they had 100 eliminations and the closest on my team was about 17 or 18. 

Then, just when we were about to lose, they‚Äôd all stand back off point and let us cap, just to drag the game out longer. They let it go all the way to the 4th round then c9ed and let us take the win. 

They plugged a twitch account at the end of the match and their stream title was ‚Äòbronze account smurfing‚Äô

They wasted 40 minutes of our lives, and even if the account gets banned, they can make another one with a 2$ sim card from a petrol station and rinse and repeat. I‚Äôm frustrated and I feel that this is one of the main reasons the game is dying.

Jared was responsible for a lot of the positive changes for OW2, Legacy credits, free new heroes etc. and was brave enough to break the sad news about PvE.

I remember Jared replied to me personally confirming the story missions will have AI teammates for solo play, I'll miss his interactions with the community.

Who could be the next executive producer??

So for context, I was in a trio with my buddies, them on pc and me on console, so we were in a mixed pool quickplay. At one point, the enemy Reinhardt pinned me against a wall and I instantly clipped into their spawn from across the map and died to spawn room damage. Anybody seen anything like this before?

2025-03-04 11:12:22,371 - INFO - Content: Am I crazy or did the devs say they were going to reduce the amount of times a solo queue would face stacks?
Particularly in the Tank role, I'm rather tired of getting a match the *nanosecond* I press Requeue, because I'm the only guy on the server dumb enough to solo queue Tank and there's 100s of stacks waiting their turn to feast on my SR. 

I know I'm the long straight piece in the matchmaker's game of Tetris, but can you please consider my experience as well instead of throwing me into these matchups over and over? This is a huge reason that Tank gets even worse as less people play. It's a problem that feeds itself. At the very least you gotta stop allowing people to queue as a 2 DPS+2 Support four stack. What are we doing here.

2025-03-04 16:45:02,915 - INFO - Content: I love playing Mercy, but I hate playing with a Mercy.
I‚Äôve been a Mercy main since 2016. Have always loved her kit through all of the changes. Jade weapon, hundreds of hours, climbed to Diamond with basically just her. Yada yada. 

But I‚Äôm also a flex support, so really only play her 1/4 games, and lately it seems like when I play someone else, Mercy is ALWAYS the other healer and maaaaan.. sometimes it feels like a throw pick. And of course, if I‚Äôm confident on Mercy, 100% so are they, especially since we‚Äôre in the same rank. But I don‚Äôt even like having her as my other healer in Unranked anymore! The other Mercy always has 0 kills, 0 damage, and 10k+ healing; and I WANT to be like ‚ÄúUSE YOUR GUN‚Äù, but then I just look like an asshole. 

I feel awful about this, because I‚Äôm sure people feel annoyed when I select her, too. Not sure if it‚Äôs the meta or something, but Mercy is unavoidable in all games‚Äî even if I‚Äôm the one playing her. Honestly, I only really play her when we have a Pharah now, which sucks because that‚Äôs terribly boring. 

I am at war with myself. Probably pointlessly.

2025-03-04 17:13:32,913 - INFO - Content: Should Blizzard bring back end of season comp points as a reward?
I know Blizzard wants us to keep playing in order to get our weapon skin/color, but as a casual player with at max 10 hours playtime a week it's going to take the whole year to get the purple weapon skin...

Back in the day I got the golden weapon in like 2/3 seasons, mostly due to end of season rewards (gold/plat player here).

I feel like I won't be able to get the purple weapon unless they do an event like the end of last season that gives you a bunch of points in a few games. In that case, why even grind comp for points?

It's ridiculous the grind that you have to do in order to get one, in my opinion they should at least  reduce the amount of games required to get the 100 guaranteed from 30 to 10 or something like that.

What are y'all's thoughts?

Is anyone else getting annoyed with being flamed for saying anything remotely positive about Overwatch?

A user made a comment shitting on Overwatch‚Äôs skin progression system in comparison to MR. As someone that enjoys both games, objectively, Overwatch‚Äôs current loot box + currency system is more generous than most games out there including MR.

Just for saying something positive about Overwatch, I got downvoted to oblivion. People are getting skins back to back with the return of free loot boxes and yet people will still complain.

It feels like you can‚Äôt say anything positive about Overwatch without people immediately trashing you and Overwatch. It‚Äôs not just like this on Reddit but also other platforms like TikTok. Are people just unable to enjoy multiple games at the same time and have to make it an either or?

If we won‚Äôt tone down the lethality of railgun, the hitbox on it, her own tiny hitbox, or her mobility then lean into making her a glass cannon instead of just a cannon. 225 hp seems perfectly reasonable and fair as a result.

2025-03-05 07:37:15,727 - INFO - Content: I don‚Äôt like Widowmaker‚Äôs design; So I redid her.
Issues:
-1 shot mechanics aren‚Äôt fun.
-She has the awesome visor, please use it damnit.
-Her design leans wayyy too hard into femme fetale when she experiences no emotions aside from the thrill of murder.

So I:
-Gave her a 210 damage headshot along with a 4 damage deployable. This is similar to the roadhog rework, but I feel the theme of mines and trapping fits alot more with the spider themed assassin
-So much more infrasight, though it was removed from the ult. She looks cooler with the visor on.
-Changed her design to be more supervillain inspired than just a latex suit. Though tbh the cape might‚Äôve ruined her silhouette in comparison to ana, so thats mb

Unlisted Changes:
Reverse damage fall off

Let me know what you think!

I like his Blocky design when he is in his Nemesis form.

I love the industrial theme surrounding his skin. And the Shoulder guns are awesome as well. Oil leaking from his body is also a nice detail. Too bad i cant buy it yet.

Each team gets two bans, I believe that Sojourn, Zarya and Ana will be banned fairly often.

My personal picks will be Doom, Ball and Widow.

If I know a person on the other team I'd swap out widow for a target ban if they are an OTP or just stupidly good on a specific hero.

People have spoken, more blood, dirt and rips. Going off of my favorite Jq line "It's not a party till someone's dead" and who knows, maybe Jq killed her groom. Added the ult voice lines, "Time for the vows!" "Let's walk 'em down the aisle!"
