(Commissioner here! Hi, I love Illari and decided she deserved one of my ideas come to life via an artist I commissioned :}
She's meant to be quite larger that the milky ways? Awwhr I know she may never get a mythic but I love her)

"When the galaxy shattered, she rose not as Illari, but as Lightwrought."

After the fall of Starwatch, Illari was remade by celestial forces into a radiant mythic being—forged to restore balance where even the stars failed. She carries Earth in her weapon, constellations in her veins, and the burden of the light itself.

Mei has been my favorite heroe since 2016,  I was surprised yesterday when I was watching a Championship match that some player picked her, is she meta?

I got almost everything in the picture as gifts (I bought the mug haha), if you have anything Mei related, SHOW ME! (Please, hehe).

P.S. Obviously not a native english speaker, don't roast me (yet, feel free to correct my grammar respectfully).

Every time Drives are happening, this and other subreddits are filled with posts talking about how bad the Drive experience is, huge losing streaks, people dropping an entire rank in search of rewards, matchmaking that makes no sense, solo players against groups of 4 or 5. Is this good for the game? Is it worth sacrificing the rest of the players' sanity to generate an increase in players on a weekend and in competitive modes? Or is this just an example of survivor bias and Drives aren't that bad and it's just a minority that's struggling? What do you think? Personally, the quality of my experience has been declining as the amount of points for rewards increases.

2025-04-21 03:38:39,555 - INFO - Content: Feel bad for tanks tbh
Played several hundred of hours of Overwatch competitively in every class and I don't think I've been blamed for losses more often than when I am tank. For every 10 to 12 games lost I'm blamed as DPS or Support bc obviously it's toxic and the sore losers are looking for someone to blame. But even though I'm a tank main, it's like two out of three games I hear "tank diff" even when I play better or on par with the other tank. It's bad enough nobody wants to play this role, than everyone treats the ones who play it like trash. 

P.S. Any negative or burner comments make you look like a sore loser too so don't try it lmao

2025-04-21 04:18:38,181 - INFO - Content: Friendly reminder that Kiriko has more skins than a hero who’s been in the game for nearly 10 years
Symmetra who has been around since OW’s launch in 2016 and once didn’t get a Legendary skin for nearly 3 whole years (Dec 2018 - July 2021).

Meanwhile Kiriko gets 5 skins every season and now has more Legendaries than Symmetra and she’s 2 and half years old. (Esports/OWL skins do not count)

I know Kiriko is simply easy character to make skin concepts of but it’s just sad when a new character gets more cosmetics than an OG character.

Also Zarya and Lucio players dealing with epic skins only since OW2 and Ram might be the next Symmetra.

I added a pic of her classic weapon for comparison but why are they so different?? 

Honestly, it almost feels like a mistake and all of them were supposed to look like the one on the left. Personally, I think it looks \_way\_ better: more depth, less dark and drab, and it actually shows the star/parallax effects that are basically invisible on the default one. 

What do you guys think? Could just be personal preference but I'd love it if they updated them all to match this look.

I was blessed with great teammates and their chat reactions made the moment even better.

2025-04-21 10:16:21,788 - INFO - Content: The final verdict on Drives from the guy who publicly crashed out on Reddit over not being able to get the first checkpoint after 6 hours of grinding.
Well my last post got a lot of discussion so I figure it’s only fair that I give the conclusion to the whole Drive situation.

I did end up finishing it. And actually I managed to get 3500 drive point much faster than I got those initial 500 lol! 

I’m conflicted because I can’t lie, Drive events are the most engaged I EVER get in comp. It’s genuinely really fun when you’re in the flow state and racking up points. It sounds tacky but there is a legit sense of achievement if slogging through the hell that is Drive weekend. Clearly not everyone does so making the time and effort to complete it does feel good at the end.

I think my main criticism still stands tho. There is absolutely no excuse why the first one or two tiers can’t be earned without losing drive points. I understand the critique I got on my last post that “this shouldn’t be a participation trophy” but at the end of the day what Blizzard cares about is engagement and nothing will overcome the frustration of playing for hours just to get close to a check point and then lose 4 in a row. The system breeds frustration and curtails engagement in the future. As satisfying as it is to finish a Drive I feel like I need a LONG break after every one.

Also I enjoy the 4 day length I think that’s a nice sweet spot because the week long drive was way too long.

2025-04-22 14:15:11,505 - INFO - Content: Who else is excited for Season 16?
I’m not gonna lie, I’ve never been more excited for a new Overwatch season. With all the things Season 16 has to offer; Stadium, Freja, the Dokiwatch skins, especially Juno’s Mythic skin, I’m eagerly waiting for Season 16 to come out. Now the season is just a few hours away from going live. Apparently, there’s also gonna be a Gundam collaboration as teased in the trailer. I’ve actually never heard of Gundam until this collaboration, but I’m sure it means something to those who have heard of it. Of course, there’s also gonna be tons of new skins releasing in the shop, as well as a new battle pass. Oh yeah, and Venture is getting another skin. Let’s go!

Overall, I’m really excited for Season 16, and with it just around the corner, I can tell I’m gonna have a fun time playing Overwatch today. How do you feel about Season 16? Are you excited as much as I am?

This really makes me mad...I accepted that the BP only had a few Dokiwatch skins, but to lock not only the new dps skin behind a bundle is just beyond greed! You could at least AT LEAST give the opinion to just buy the skin in the hero gallery....Im not happy about this at all. 

Also, no one plz don't say "well it'll be in lootboxes next season" THAT IS NOT A GOOD EXCUSE. It could take me YEARs to get this skin from a lootbox. I have $20 right now that I would happily spend to get the skin now....

I just refuse to believe that this is the same character. Isn't she supposed to be a strong mace-swinging squire to a Crusader? 

Blizzard also said they'd fix the Sparkplug skin, because that one was also super skinny, but they never did. Is it too much to ask that we get a Brigitte with some meat on her?

If you can't level your Battle Pass in this mode it's going to discourage a lot of people from playing it. 

Also, why is this even a thing? You get more XP playing Arcade
