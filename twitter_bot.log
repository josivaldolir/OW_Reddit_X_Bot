Out of all the Overwatch cinematics, especially the newer ones that are just meant to introduce characters.

This one manages to tell an actually emotional story, introduces viewer to lore and its charachters and ‚Äútechnically‚Äù progresses the story forward. It very short time that it has it achieves a lot.

This is so dumb. Like, extremely dumb. Trust me, I know. But I was hoping someone in here could relate. 

I could be playing my ass off. Like, healing tf out of everyone. 10+ saves in a match, really going in, you know? Only for my team to be like ‚ÄúCLUTCH MERCY‚Äù or ‚Äúily mercy‚Äù or ‚Äúmercy is the goat‚Äù. 

I‚Äôve had matches where I have done literally over 2k more healing than the mercy on my team, yet my entire team will be hyping up the mercy at the end of the match. Like, I understand the revive, but come on. 

I‚Äôm not a stingy Moira. I focus on my team and throw more healing orbs than damage. I run out of my healing spray so often in every match that I play. 

Literally just finished a match where I had over 10k healing, and our Mercy had her pistol out the majority of the match with 6k healing, and someone sent in the chat ‚Äúyalls mercy trash. ours is the goat‚Äù meanwhile I saved their ass at least 3 times in the match. 

I‚Äôm definitely just venting, and again, this is so so dumb. But like, no one ever thanks the Moira. üòîüòîüòî

I play a lot later during the day without lights on, and the light background really grinds my gears, especially because UI in terms of theme is inconsistent - challenges and play has dark background and sometimes menu screen is, but other ones are not, and you go to menu or heroes page and you're eyes are immediately hit with a lot of white light.

2025-07-06 11:13:46,761 - INFO - Content: To combat smurfing OW has killed the new player experience
I'm trying to get into overwatch, and I'm pretty new to FPS in general. I don't have any mechanics. My DPS rank is likely low bronze. I started doing some aim training and watching youtube videos, but I still really can't hit anything.

The problem is that the systems puts you in gold no matter what. My QP went i think 10-40 (wins were  mostly disconnects on opposite team, or trolling), then I went 0-10 in my placements. I still placed in gold. I'm now 8-40, and I'm still silver 2.

I was told to just keep playing and it'll eventually derank me... but it takes so long. And every game I'm absolutely the worst player.

Overestimating new account ranks is supposed help lower level players vs smurfs, but instead it's killed the new player experience completely if you aren't already cracked at FPS coming in. 

"Just play what's fun for you". Getting absolutely trashed is not fun. And it sucks for my teammates as well. It ruins games when matchmaking fails.

"Play a hero that is less mechanically intense" -  I want to learn to play hitscan dps. This is about matchmaking, not hero selection. There will always be bad players, we are allowed to play ranked too.

I really hope the devs see this and come up with a better solution.
