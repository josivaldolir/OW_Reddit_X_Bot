Out of all the Overwatch cinematics, especially the newer ones that are just meant to introduce characters.

This one manages to tell an actually emotional story, introduces viewer to lore and its charachters and ‚Äútechnically‚Äù progresses the story forward. It very short time that it has it achieves a lot.

This is so dumb. Like, extremely dumb. Trust me, I know. But I was hoping someone in here could relate. 

I could be playing my ass off. Like, healing tf out of everyone. 10+ saves in a match, really going in, you know? Only for my team to be like ‚ÄúCLUTCH MERCY‚Äù or ‚Äúily mercy‚Äù or ‚Äúmercy is the goat‚Äù. 

I‚Äôve had matches where I have done literally over 2k more healing than the mercy on my team, yet my entire team will be hyping up the mercy at the end of the match. Like, I understand the revive, but come on. 

I‚Äôm not a stingy Moira. I focus on my team and throw more healing orbs than damage. I run out of my healing spray so often in every match that I play. 

Literally just finished a match where I had over 10k healing, and our Mercy had her pistol out the majority of the match with 6k healing, and someone sent in the chat ‚Äúyalls mercy trash. ours is the goat‚Äù meanwhile I saved their ass at least 3 times in the match. 

I‚Äôm definitely just venting, and again, this is so so dumb. But like, no one ever thanks the Moira. üòîüòîüòî

I play a lot later during the day without lights on, and the light background really grinds my gears, especially because UI in terms of theme is inconsistent - challenges and play has dark background and sometimes menu screen is, but other ones are not, and you go to menu or heroes page and you're eyes are immediately hit with a lot of white light.

2025-07-06 11:13:46,761 - INFO - Content: To combat smurfing OW has killed the new player experience
I'm trying to get into overwatch, and I'm pretty new to FPS in general. I don't have any mechanics. My DPS rank is likely low bronze. I started doing some aim training and watching youtube videos, but I still really can't hit anything.

The problem is that the systems puts you in gold no matter what. My QP went i think 10-40 (wins were  mostly disconnects on opposite team, or trolling), then I went 0-10 in my placements. I still placed in gold. I'm now 8-40, and I'm still silver 2.

I was told to just keep playing and it'll eventually derank me... but it takes so long. And every game I'm absolutely the worst player.

Overestimating new account ranks is supposed help lower level players vs smurfs, but instead it's killed the new player experience completely if you aren't already cracked at FPS coming in. 

"Just play what's fun for you". Getting absolutely trashed is not fun. And it sucks for my teammates as well. It ruins games when matchmaking fails.

"Play a hero that is less mechanically intense" -  I want to learn to play hitscan dps. This is about matchmaking, not hero selection. There will always be bad players, we are allowed to play ranked too.

I really hope the devs see this and come up with a better solution.

i love the pink mercy staff and i always use it on my other skins too, but WHY is the pink color beam attached to the pink/rose gold mercy SKIN and not the weapon?? i really wanna have the pink healing beam on princess, fearless, and sakura mercy, but it's tied to the rose gold skin itself rather than the weapon.

I encountered this Sigma bug where the shield appears cracking even though just deployed and full HP. Really distracting even though it was restored to correct form on the next round.

Guys i got a funnier followup from my previous post. Instead of a reset on a round, we just had a full draw in a role q match. Something happening to someones internet ig. The same error kept popping up "The server closed due to an unexpected error." We went through a full 9 rounds, 3 of which got terminated, and then the game just ended.

Time to blog because apparently my thoughts are necessary to separate this post from a low-quality post. I mean, one-person's low quality is another person's legendary lootbox. I just snapped Mei making a suggestive face in a real game, and I thought that was quite amusing. We live in a society. Bottom text. 

Is this enough? It would be nice to know the line. Stadium is honestly the best mode and I really hope they continue to invest in it. I've played 14,000 hours of Dota 2, so this game is truly amazing since it gives me the same buildcrafting decision-based player fantasy. As someone who can't aim for shit and tends to play Support, I can achieve Legend rank in stadium with superior analysis of the meta and enemy heroes, building against our weaknesses and accentuating our strengths. Good job Blizzard!

Jeez, I had to make my own custom game just to visit Aatlis. A bunch of FOMO try-hards decided from day one that the map was trash, and the rest of you followed like good little soldiers. Get out of your comfort zone and vote for Aatlis so we can actually learn it and form an educated opinion. You're just sending the message to Blizzard that you don‚Äôt want any new maps at all. I hate when the first wave of critics crucifies something so hard that nobody afterward feels allowed to make up their own mind.

Edit: ok ok my bad, I‚Äôm wrong, you‚Äôre all game design geniuses who have asserted an educated  and exhaustive analysis within a reasonable weekly playtime for a map that came out less than two weeks ago.

2025-07-08 08:22:44,781 - INFO - Content: Now that we have map voting, it's time to put the Assault(2CP) maps back into the Quickplay pool.
If I'm going to be forced into playing the occasional Clash map even though they've been removed from Comp and no one likes them, I see no reason why we can't have Temple of Anubis, Volskaya Industries, Paris, Hanamura, and Horizon Lunar Colony in the map pool for Quickplay.

I could understand when we didn't have a choice. I could understand if they took Clash out completely. But having to play Clash maps I hate without having the option to play maps I like is kinda insane. End the madness Blizz.

2025-07-09 20:18:20,511 - INFO - Content: It's been almost a year and people still don't know how Juno's Hyper Ring (speed boost) works
I always pay attention to how my teammates are using Hyper Ring before the match starts and it's crazy how people have many different strategies, but they are all inefficient in different levels and it's probaby because they don't know how the ability works, despite many of these Juno players having over 50 hours on her (not their fault though, there's a very unintuitive part about it). So here are the main things you need to know about it to learn how to properly use it:

Hyper Ring is actually a projectile (that can't be eaten/blocked, likely because it can't harm the enemy) that shortly stops after being fired and stays active as a static ring for a few seconds. However, even it's not visually there, the projectile is the size of the final ring, and the speed boost is activated when teammates are affected by the projectile, before it becomes a static ring.

In other words, anyone caught in front of you will gain the speed buff, and passing through the ring will refresh the buff. Juno instantly gets the buff upon using Hyper Ring no matter what, and she can also refresh it by passing through the ring.

So when the match starts, the best way to use it is behind your teammates and when the spawn door opens, not before. Just make sure they are affected by the initial projectile, and if the map geometry allows it, make sure they can refresh the duration but passing through the ring shortly after.

And as Juno player, don't be afraid to use it for yourself, knowing you instantly get the speed boost without having to compromise your positioning to pass through the ring.

So when the match starts, the best way to use it is behind your teammates and when the spawn door opens, not before. Just make sure they are affected by the initial projectile, and if the map geometry allows it, make sure they can refresh the duration but passing through the ring shortly after.

And as Juno player, don't be afraid to use it for yourself, knowing you instantly get the speed boost without having to compromise your positioning to pass through the ring.

2025-07-09 21:39:18,737 - INFO - Content: It's been almost a year and people still don't know how Juno's Hyper Ring (speed boost) works
I always pay attention to how my teammates are using Hyper Ring before the match starts and it's crazy how people have many different strategies, but they are all inefficient in different levels and it's probaby because they don't know how the ability works, despite many of these Juno players having over 50 hours on her (not their fault though, there's a very unintuitive part about it). So here are the main things you need to know about it to learn how to properly use it:

Hyper Ring is actually a projectile (that can't be eaten/blocked, likely because it can't harm the enemy) that shortly stops after being fired and stays active as a static ring for a few seconds. However, even it's not visually there, the projectile is the size of the final ring, and the speed boost is activated when teammates are affected by the projectile, before it becomes a static ring.

In other words, anyone caught in front of you will gain the speed buff, and passing through the ring will refresh the buff. Juno instantly gets the buff upon using Hyper Ring no matter what, and she can also refresh it by passing through the ring.
