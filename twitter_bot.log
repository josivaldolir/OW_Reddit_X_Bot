2025-03-23 08:17:09,721 - INFO - Content: No, Mercy is NOT the problem with Sojourn
I've seen people say that Mercy is the reason Sojourn is so dominant, and nerfing her will put Soj back in line. I strongly disagree.

Sojourn is already too good without a Mercy pocket. Way too much survivability for a high damage high kill potential and high mobility hero. Having that Mercy just makes the problem even worse. But it's still a problem if you take Mercy out of the equation.

We can compare it to PharMercy. Pharah has a clear weakness without a Mercy pocket. Sojourn does not.

Solution is simple - Sojourn to 225 HP. Nerfing Mercy would just absolutely kill an already pretty poor character being boosted up by Soj.

Stop being an asshole about everyone being on mic on 6v6. Maybe the one tank doesn't want to talk to you after you were being a jerk on the mic. Maybe you can just relax. It's just a game and some people just want to have fun or have had a bad experience on the mic (shocking, I know).

I recently started playing ow2 after being a casual enjoyer of the first game, I‚Äôve been playing for less then a week now and it‚Äôs been relatively fun. I haven‚Äôt actually had any bad interaction until yesterday. Maybe it‚Äôs too early to say this, but every match I go in to is just a mess. Either it‚Äôs other people telling me I play bad or it‚Äôs people arguing and screaming at each other. To me, the worst part about all this is that I can‚Äôt defend myself, no literally, I have no chat function (accounts about 8 days old). Genuinely trying my hardest to do better but with the constant pressure of the ‚Äújunkrats throwing‚Äù chat messages, it fucks up any sort of motivation to play. I remember OW being toxic (but hey, that‚Äôs sorta a common ground among hero fighter games) but not THIS toxic. What the hell changed?

2025-03-23 22:39:19,945 - INFO - Content: Blizzard Servers Down due to DDOS Targeted Attacks on World of Warcraft Hardcore
Seen many posts the past couple weeks and as a player of both Overwatch and World of Warcraft, wanted to share some explaination why Blizzard servers keep going down.

This Wowhead article linked explains a bit more on how the DDOS attacks the past three weeks have overlapped with the Race to World First (RWF) events for retail and hardcore versions. For retail, Liquid (the leasing U.S. based team) was unable to even log into the game for a few hours each day (yet still ended up winning!) due to the attacks, which also affected Overwatch. 

Today and yesterday was the most punishing attack for classic Hardcore players (a mode in World of Warcraft which if you die, you have to start over from scratch) which can take weeks of playtime to get to the raid that the OnlyFangs streamer guild was attempting to compete today. Unfortunately, 1/3 - 1/2 of their guild was wiped due to the DDOS attack and they're most likely disbanding due to a lack of any rollbacks from Blizzard's end. 

Overwatch servers and all other Blizzard games going down is just a byproduct of this attack. Targeted DDOS attacks like this are notorious for being difficult to defend against, which sucks for all of us :( Hopefully we will see some less of these, but it's still a sucky situation to be in for everyone!
