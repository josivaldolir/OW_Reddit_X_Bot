2025-04-08 08:20:40,593 - INFO - Content: Now that the season is two weeks from finishing what is everyone’s final opinion on the return of lootboxes?
Picture attached is how many lootboxes I have earned up til this point (minus one.. don’t ask) 

Over 100 lootboxes before the end of the season is insanely generous. With pity system and 3 guaranteed legendaries I have been able to confirm at minimum 8 legendary skins from lootboxes alone. Maybe more if I get lucky.

I know next season won’t be as “charitable” but damn I hope they let us have at least 50 lootboxes per season with maybe 10 lootboxes being earnable through other methods.

(I'm new to Reddit, so the image didn't show up properly—reuploading it here!)  
  
Hi everyone! I'm a Korean Overwatch player.  
I came back for Season 15, and to celebrate the LE SSERAFIM collab, I made a pixel art version in the style of MapleStory, one of my favorite games! >w<  
(Hopefully I can do something for a second collab someday too!)  
Hope you all enjoy it! That’s all from me—bye\~ :)

Why this Juno skin is so detailed. If you look closer there are muscle on her shoulders and her armplts is so detailed and don't forget the hips line too. Like what the hell if you compare this skin to other Le Serafim skins the other skins are just bland compare to the Juno skin if they just add abs this skin will be perfect I will buy this skin 2x the price. Look for Soul Fighter Samira in L3ague her splash art has abs on it and it's so good.

Of all the skins I've purchased in other games like L3ague, Warz0ne, Rlvals, This specific Juno skins is the one I've felt happy that I bought this skin unlike the skins I bought in other games like, Yeah I bought it because I don't have a skin on this hero or it's just look cool. But this one is different and this will be my top personal favorite skin of all the games I've played.

i love magical girl anime’s and have wanted themed skins around that for ages. i was so excited when my prayers were answered and  dokiwatch was announced. The artowork for the skins came out and i fell in love. if we didn’t get a magical girl season, i think a mermaid/aquatic theme could have been cool.

Just died as an Ana to a Mei who cryo-froze on top, while I dropped to below. I was still slowed down even though I had no LOS to Mei. I thought it works similar to the ult, where walls block LOS. Am I mistaken, or is this a bug?

2025-04-09 01:09:25,728 - INFO - Content: Blizzard is killing it
Blizzard just released a patch for a 2-week event. That's insane. Do you remember when we would get one mid season patch and maybe a hot fix each season? This is an incredible turnaround and it's awesome to see them listening to the community and responding so quickly.

I didn't even expect wrecking ball to return to normalwatch after the invincibility bug yet they had fixed that in around 24 hours!!!

Yes, it's not a perfect game, but it's our imperfect game. Thank you blizzard for the lootboxes, the countless free legendary skins through events/twitch drops/discord quests, thank you for making a game where me and my friends can have fun together from 1000 miles apart.

Yea, let's lose this one. I don't care anymore. If you're gonna be a garbage instalock DPS, you can have fun like that then. Enjoy not having a tank. Or a second healer. I'm so over these people lol.

I thought having another tank would alleviate the stress of being the "foundation" of your team. And that is true, but you just feel sooo weak. 

I like being the raid boss. I like charging in and not immediately exploding. Your mere presence is impactful in 5v5. And if you don't want the stress? Just queue dps or support. I think its fine there is a role that is significantly more important, you dont have to play it!

I started playing with overwatch 2, so I’ve always played 5v5. I was trying to like 6v6 since it dropped, but I’m having the worst experience, most of the games no one picks support so im the only support player trying to keep 5 ppl alive, other games no one picks tank, and there are games where we have 4 support. I’ve rarely played a 2-2-2. I try to speak to my teammates in chat but they don’t listen. Gold rank BTW, what should i do?

2025-04-09 15:42:32,294 - INFO - Content: The matchmaking is ruining the game for me
I want to start off by saying I'm a plat player, and I 100% deserve to be in plat. I got placed in diamond 1 on the 6v6 placements and immediately stopped playing as I knew I was going to derank at a record-winning speed. I don't mind that I'm not ranking up. 

But when I get 9 wins in a row IMMEDIATELY followed by 12 losses in a row, all the joy of the game is sucked out for me. It feels like all my games are either my team stomping the enemy team or my team getting stomped. There have been too many gams where theres a dps/tank getting almost no (or sometimes actually getting 0 kills), or a support player just dpsing with 1k healing after 10 min. 

I don't know if its because of the way the game works or if its people smurfing/getting boosted/getting lucky in placements or just a skill-issue on my part, but getting stomped/stomping is not fun. The games that are actually close, where you can't tell within 1 minute that you're going to lose or win are the games that are enjoyable to play, even if you end up losing.

2025-04-09 16:19:12,761 - INFO - Content: "Main" and "Off" Tanks, a relic from the past?
Recently I saw some discussion around the format and the aspect of the quality of "Main" tanking as opposed to "Off" tanking caught my 
 
From what I've read, people express their discontent of having to play main tank, because they have to do the same thing they did before, just with less hp, boop resistance, passives and shitty armor. 
All while the "Off" tank is chilling on an angle denying value from flankers. 

Is this truly a format issue? 

6v6 is being reintroduced with all the changes to balance and system in the game, especially the new characters from OW2.

Now I ask, are the terms "Main" and "Off" tank still applicable, relevant or even restricting in the new state of the game?
How do Junkerqueen, Mauga, Tankfist or Hazard fit in?
Is tank synergy really that important or should you pick depending on map/overall team comp?
Lmk your thoughts.

I hope you like it because I love to design clothes so I had a lot of fun doing this. Sorry if the silhouette doesn't exactly match, I mostly did it just for fun not for functionality. 

You can see more overwatch canary on my Instagram and reddit profiles. Thank you.

2025-04-09 21:12:21,230 - INFO - Content: Support on Support crime is so funny to me.
I was playing control in 6v6 competitive and halfway through the first point, our Mercy was just being toxic in match chat. Of course, they’re the only one not in VC and our Kiriko was getting frustrated with them typing all game because she couldn’t keep us alive solo. 

We commented on how much they’re typing and our Kiriko said in VC “I could type more if I had 9 of my fingers free while playing my character”

I just couldn’t stop laughing at this interaction. We just reported our mercy and moved on, but support on support beef is just funny af.

After 2k hours in this game I can’t seem to win any of my games… I’ve never had this many losses. I’m not even mad or raging but 2 months of losing 90% of my matches has been miserable. My rank hasn’t changed and I’ve tried every role, and every mode and it’s always the same week after week to where I’m not even playing anymore. Am I alone in this or is everyone else also getting incredibly one sided matches?

Suddenly people are having trouble connecting and even getting penalized for it.  I'm afraid to even reconnect after the suspension since it may happen again and give me and even longer one.

My endorsement level already went down too which is a shame.

2025-04-10 01:09:07,007 - INFO - Content: With it having been over a month since they were released, how do you feel about perks and their implementation?
Personally, I've really enjoyed the extra nuance that choosing your perks brings, as well as the incentive they give you to stay on one character and not counterswap.

I will say, however, that my enjoyment of the former hinges on both perk options being equal, and in cases where one perk is significantly better than the other, it feels like the perk system falters.

What do you think?

So, this is from the Samoa map. I don't know if it's always been there, I only noticed it after the reveal for Aqua. Do y'all think maybe this is from him? He seemed like some kind of water bender so it'd be cool for him to be from a tropical region like Samoa even if he isn't directly Samoan.

Does anyone else also get this? I've heard from others that it was supposed to be fixed.

As someone who frequently uses the replay viewer, it is very frustrating that whenever I use time step or skip in the timeline, there is a very high chance of the game to either black screen, or log me out.

Does anyone know anything about this? ill be posting on forums as well to see what I can learn.

I got too impatient for next season! I needed her now lol. 

Right now, she's unfinished since I'm unable to see the backside enough to make the backpack and what not, but I was too excited to not share a progression picture!

She's made through mostly crochet, with a small bit of needle felting for details. The arms and sharks are both movable, to allow for some posing. 

Hope you guys enjoyed!

Have a wonderful day!

Hog, Junkrat, Moira, Widow, and Sombra are the only characters I know of who have clown skins, but I want them to go all out with the clowns. Someone made a skin concept for ball and it's fucking awesome.

I’ve been stuck plat 1 support for a year. Three days ago I hit diamond 5 - which I sometimes do before going on a losing streak but *this* time I climbed from plat 1 to diamond 2. I’ve gone from playing with golds and plats to masters in three days and it’s like a psychological horror. They are ACTUALLY thinking and I’m like Patrick from spongebob in comparison. And the amount of blame I get now.. *starts crying and shaking* 

There’s no point to this post, I’m just confused and awaiting the biggest losing streak to ever hit me, wish me luck :’)

2025-04-10 23:37:08,151 - INFO - Content: Why do I feel an immediate and deep sense of camaraderie with other Reinhardt players?
I've recently discovered a love for playing Rein.  And I don't know why, but anytime I see a Rein on the enemy team I feel really warmly towards them. I write 'Love you Rein' in chat, wave hello to them constantly, and if I'm doing much better than the other Rein I'll message the other team stuff like 'You be nice to your tank!' And of course I always, ALWAYS want to 1v1 the enemy Rein. 

Why does Reinhardt bring this out of me when playing against others who are running the same character as me don't?

2025-04-11 08:20:58,607 - INFO - Content: Are other Mercy players going through this?
Bit of a rant, sorry for that.
I've been having a pretty miserable time playing Mercy lately and I'm not talking about her gameplay. For context, I'm a pretty casual player and I stick to quickplay only.

I know she isn't the best hero meta wise right now, but I find her fun and I'm decent at her. I play her how she is intended. Nothing crazy, nothing terrible, I support my teammates and do my best not to die. But every single game, and I mean almost *every game*, I run into toxic player after toxic player on my team or the enemy team specifically targeting me.

Tanks getting mad at me for stuff very out of my control, spam asking for healing and dps getting mad at me if I don't pocket one of them enough, mean comments, general weirdness, you name it. I like keeping chat on because I'm nosy, but its been so constant that I decided to turn it off permanently. I can take criticism, but again, none of my mistakes warrant backlash of this intensity most of the time and I feel like any mistake (especially in quickplay) doesn't warrant any toxicity.

For the enemy team, yes, I'm aware that targeting supports is crucial to winning, that isn't what I am talking about here. I've been running into far more spawn campers lately than I ever have playing ow2, along with a lot more t-bagging despite me making sure I have never done anything to warrant it.

I ran into the same enemy venture two games in a row who made it their mission to use every toxic behavior you can imagine and there wasn't much I could do, even after swapping heroes. I can ignore toxicity just fine since its an inevitability playing these games for the record, but again its been so unbelievably rampant for me I am definitely taking a break from the game until things have hopefully chilled out. Made me wonder if anyone else is going through this, I dunno. I don't expect anyone to be friendly with me for playing Mercy or anything, and I don't expect a game to have zero toxicity, but I will say I've seen Mercy players get this treatment far more than any other mains, and it doesn't make sense to me.

Let me know what you think or share your experiences so I don't feel like I'm going crazy.

TL;DR: Been getting awful treatment by either team every game for the past week or two. I'm attributing it to me playing Mercy because that's usually how these things go, but it could just be an overwatch thing, quickplay thing, or both I dunno.

Not much context is needed. I prefer holding damage boost on an anti-naded target I intend on healing once the debuff expires. This Bastion didn't realize they had the anti-nade debuff and made this comment I find funny. I checked in the replay, there wasn't a single frame where I could have healed Bastion before they were eliminated.

2025-04-11 18:21:32,939 - INFO - Content: I climbed from Bronze to mid-Diamond over several years, this is what i noticed for EACH rank:
* Bronze: Poor grasp of the each CD and just a bad awareness overall.
* Silver: Basic CD usage and poor aim.  Lots of tug-o-war fights at chokepoints with little to no flanking.  Most of the outcomes only happen with ultimates.
* Gold: Mid-gold is pretty amateurish since they don't spend their CDs at every CD or just don't shoot enough.  Also they still don't actually secure elim purposefully.  Just low impact overall.  Still do dumb things like die because you didn't fall back 5 seconds earlier.  They still can't think 5 seconds ahead when your whole team's dead and the train is coming for you.
* Plat: Mid-plat is where you FINALLY see people doing heroes' intended combo kills consistently.  Blink and you're dead by the Genji's dash/righclick/melee in a flash.   Or how about ana going shoot + nade + shoot + melee.  mid-Plat ball gets scary since they will crush/boop/8headshots/melee you under 2 seconds.
* Diamond: For me, it's pretty scary.  Hyper-awareness in positioning and game sense.  This is where you see your own Mercy intentionally body-soak damages in front of you so you barely get to live.  If 76 or High Noon ult happens, everyone goes crazy to kill you, not hide.  You realize... It was all about high ground / corners / positioning all along.  I've died as well as killed because I was or enemy was literally 5 steps out of position for 2 seconds.

I might add.... people still don't group up consistently even at mid-Diamond LOL.  So many awkward walks as a tank because the Moira wanted to dive solo and die for some reason.

They had already announced it would happen april 15-21 on a previous blue post but now it seems they pushed it back 3 days. Last drive lasted 6 days but if this one is starting on a friday we might be looking at a weekend drive again like the first one. Not cool

I've seen plenty of people say this, and you're right. The robust ping system is wholly inadequate to communicate game-critical information like "fall back" and "attack the objective". 

It's important to keep chat enabled to get the true, holistic experience of playing with a nonstop barrage of deranged sociopaths providing valuable insight like "XYZ throwing" -- without, mind you, understanding that "throwing" is not the same thing as "being bad", but nobody playing this game seems to know that -- and cutting-edge analysis like "<role> diff" that really makes the game a pleasure to play.

2025-04-12 18:42:55,749 - INFO - Content: Diablo skins should be in Loot Boxes because it was not a collab
Why it was not a collab:

1. All the official collabs are Overwatch x Collab, for example Overwatch x World of Warcraft. The Rise of Darkness was the name of the event.
2. The skins were scattered all over the place. Azmodan Hammond for free, 2 skins in the Ultimate BP, skins in BP, etc. All the official colabs had skins only in shop.
3. The most important, the Diablo skins are available in Maximilien's Vault. If Diablo event was a collab, why we don't have skins from Transformers of World or Warcraft in Maximilien's Vault?!

Hey! So I made this version to match the aesthetic of Happy Nation and further add some details here and there. This is what I’d consider my true vision for the book’s look. I’m gonna place the full comic in the comments below, as the last four pages couldn’t fit in the entire post.

Besides getting everything for free, what would you like to see for the future of Overwatch? It could be reasonable things or completely unrealistic. After the rollout of changes such as perks and playing the April Fool’s Normalwatch mode, I was thinking about all the fun things Blizzard could explore. 

Examples:

-Queue for specific maps/modes

-More in-game character interaction such as Lifeweaver’s pull or Hanzo riding Orisa

-Keep bringing the winnable loot boxes!

Eichenwalde: After you capture the first point on offense, and begin to push the cart, I wish there was another entry to the other side of the wall that defense is on. Your options are, effectively, main gate that gets pushed open, the exits right past them (two exits), or the small corridor right before them (two exits; one primarily going through the upstairs cabin). Ultimately, though, the result is the same - you come to the other side - five dif't options - and yet they're all within a few feet, on the same level, having to face, effectively, the same direction - however, the enemy (defense) has a wide variety of heights to be standing from, or cubbies/walls to be hiding behind. 

Some characters can jump above the dilapidated wall and find themselves on the other side with some height, but it's limited to characters with great jump/boost or some type of flight. 

This bothers me for two reasons. 1) In hundreds of games on this map, this is always the sticking point where it becomes boring. First point also has a choke point, but it's early game and there's always friction early... and late game starts opening up. But I feel like if teams are evenly matched, it's just five minutes of standing around the broken gate or just past it. When defense wins, it always seems to be here (in my games, at least). 2) If offense is successful, the run from spawn to the next point is long and boring... it's so. much. downtime. 

I have a few quibbles with every map, but I totally "Get it" and I can accept, typically, it's more a "me" problem. But in my small circle of IRL friends that I play with, we all tend to agree that this map's pacing is boring mid-game and a small adjustment to first capture point spawn and options to make forward momentum would be a huge improvement. Just knocking down the dilapidated wall and letting any character take this path would be a small, but possibly effective change.
