With Wuayng‚Äôs hero trial coming up in the next seasom, are there any hopes you all have for his possible kit?

Personally, I think it would be really cool if he‚Äôs another melee healer like Brig, mostly because I love the bo staff as a weapon and his outfit kinda gives me martial artist vibes.

Also, I really hope he has a cleanse somewhere in his base kit (no perk necessary) since it just makes sense for a water-based hero to have a cleanse imo. Plus, it would allow for another anti-heal counter in case Kiriko gets banned!

This beast took me a bit to make, but I can finally say I'm done with her, Ashe's Viper. The bullets in the pouch can be taken out and put back in, and the lever has a little bit of self lever action thanks to the addition of magnets on the gun and the lever. 

I hope you all have a wonderful day! Thank you so much for taking the time to check out my creation!

2025-06-20 19:12:31,051 - INFO - Content: How did Overwatch manage to make a game where Damage is the least popular role?
I'm not even hating. It's genuinely a historical gaming anomaly to see the damage dealing role be the least popular of the big three archetypes.

Remember that the swap to 5v5 was because tank was the least popular role, and the bad ratio of players in the queues was leading to long wait-times for players of more popular roles. At the time, people argued that this might be unavoidable because it's just how it works in every game. Be it, MMOs, MOBAs, heck, even table-tops, it's always the same; everyone wants to be the star, the play-maker, the one on the kill feed, the one that makes the biggest number appear above the monster's head. This has been an issue since role-based games first came into existence, and every single game deals with it so we figured it was just human psychology.

So you just gotta ask: **How?**

It honestly deserves to be studied. How in the world did Overwatch turn gaming on its head and make SUPPORT the most popular role, and tank more popular than DPS? That is just wild to me.

Just played a match where Mercy got banned, and in response, a Mercy main and her boyfriend duo both decided to have a date in the corner of the map for the entire match instead of actually playing the game. 

I have a feeling that this isn‚Äôt exactly a rare occurrence (especially with a character that has as many one-tricks as Mercy) but regardless, these people should receive punishment from Blizzard as they are actively ruining the game for everyone.

For me, I compulsively hit reload. It's completely mechanical and has cost me so many times. I tried key binding it out of reach and my lizard brain learned to stretch for it. I got rid of it all together and that was even worse. I'm resigned to being a reloader.

What's your Achilles heel?

I am not the first and definitely am not the last who will continue to struggle in Drives as a Solo-Que. I been playing since 2017 so save me the whole "look inward and summon your Overwatch spirit animal to correct your team and win" ........Trust me there is NOTHING I do can help some of these individuals I am paired with...

 These matches come down to everyone doing their best at what they pick and it should not be anyone's sole duty to carry everyone. Also Solo-Que should never be paired against stacks. It's just a trolling system that embellishes stacks with ez wins and a golden road to all rewards. Most of the times you see a Solo-Que mention how terrible the matchmaking is, there is always someone with a dedicated stack or team who tells everyone how bad they are and should be better. Trust me, nothing some of us Solo-Que players can save the game when you have players who absolutely do not try and are just there for "funsies".

2025-06-22 15:39:31,098 - INFO - Content: I feel like Freja is just a better Echo
Her M1 is more accurate at range, does more against armor due to being larger dmg per projectile, Echos M1 is likley only to do headshot damage on one of the projectiles instead of all 3 unless youre point blank.

Frejas M2 is just straight up better sticky bombs. Theyre faster, way shorter cooldown, kills a squishy in 2 quick sticks with a single dash. Makes tanks lives hell. Peek a corner and stick any 250hp character twice in less than a second then vanish. Echo also probably wont be hitting 100% of her sticky volley unless shes close.

Frejas movement makes it much harder to hit her than it does with echo since echo is fairly large and has very slippery/slidey movement outside of her initial dash with flight.

Echo does have her E beam which can finish off high hp targets, but freja can do it from further range just spamming take aim shots.

In most cases it feels like freja just does what echo does, from any range, with much less risk. Echo is a glass cannon who is annihilated by any half decent hitscan while freja is a gnat that can 2 tap you while being significantly harder to hit.

2025-06-22 21:13:44,744 - INFO - Content: I feel like Freja is just a better Echo
Her M1 is more accurate at range, does more against armor due to being larger dmg per projectile, Echos M1 is likley only to do headshot damage on one of the projectiles instead of all 3 unless youre point blank.

Frejas M2 is just straight up better sticky bombs. Theyre faster, way shorter cooldown, kills a squishy in 2 quick sticks with a single dash. Makes tanks lives hell. Peek a corner and stick any 250hp character twice in less than a second then vanish. Echo also probably wont be hitting 100% of her sticky volley unless shes close.

Frejas movement makes it much harder to hit her than it does with echo since echo is fairly large and has very slippery/slidey movement outside of her initial dash with flight.

Echo does have her E beam which can finish off high hp targets, but freja can do it from further range just spamming take aim shots.

In most cases it feels like freja just does what echo does, from any range, with much less risk. Echo is a glass cannon who is annihilated by any half decent hitscan while freja is a gnat that can 2 tap you while being significantly harder to hit.

My skill rating (SR) took a nose dive after the drives started. Was trying to grind for Diamond during the Drive, but that's not going to happen now, haha. 5v5 hasn't been much better, unfortunately. How's your experience been so far?

2025-06-23 21:15:21,429 - INFO - Content: StadiumBuilds.io by the Numbers: What You Built in Season 16 (and a lil' teaser)
Hey everyone, Austin here (aka Nomabond). The last month has been wild, so I wanted to share what‚Äôs new, what‚Äôs improved, and what‚Äôs coming next on [**StadiumBuilds.io**](https://stadiumbuilds.io).

Let‚Äôs get into it üëá

# üèÜ Season 16 Rewind is Live!

I just dropped our **first ever season wrap-up**:

üîó [**https://stadiumbuilds.io/season16-rewind**](https://stadiumbuilds.io/season16-rewind)

* **3,475 builds** from 1,931 builders
* **25,278 likes** across the site
* Over **2.2 million views**
* Top builds, hero usage charts, and more
* Log in to see **your** personal stats

This will be a regular thing now as a little seasonal celebration of the chaos you all cook up.

# üìä Brand New: Live Meta Analytics

Want to see how Stadium Mode evolved week-by-week?

üîó [**https://stadiumbuilds.io/insights**](https://stadiumbuilds.io/insights) (login required)

We now track:

* **Most used items and heroes**
* Stat shifts and meta swings
* Everything rendered live from the DB, no smoke, no mirrors

Whether you theorycraft or just like to nerd out on trends, this page is for you.

# üõ†Ô∏è Quality of Life & UX Overhauls

* **New Home Page** with live stats + smoother navigation
* Hero picker redesign
* Optional Powers finally behave
* Average round price filtering + better filters overall
* **Comment threading** is fixed + cleaner replies
* Round notes now support **images**, **GIFs**, **YouTube links**, and up to **10,000 characters**
* Unsaved changes modal so you don‚Äôt lose your thoughts mid-round
* Profanity filtering on pronouns.. üò¨ (you know who you are)

# üöÄ Site Performance Got a Massive Buff

* Redis-powered view tracking (way faster, way more accurate)
* CDN + cache invalidation overhaul = fewer janky loads
* Fixed re-render bugs, reduced layout shift, squashed a ton of weird edge cases

# üí¨ Supporter Features (and a Sneak Peek)

* Dedicated [**Supporters Page**](https://stadiumbuilds.io/supporters)
* Patch Notes tab
* üéÅ Supporter-only build & profile flair, custom site themes, new layouts, profile perks, permalinks 

>I've been quietly working on a \*\*real-time enhancement\*\* to how you interact with builds. Think less alt-tabbing, more time focused on winning. :)   
  
You're going to love it!

This project started as something I built for my wife and now we‚Äôre getting thousands of players every week. Thank you for the support, the memes, the builds, and the chaos. Seriously.

As always: feedback, bug reports, hype, and memes welcome in the replies or in the Discord!

Keep building friends,  
**‚Äì Nomabond**

2025-06-23 22:43:02,931 - INFO - Content: Character silhouettes revealed back in 2020
Back in 2020 before overwatch 2 released, blizzard revealed 4 silhouettes of some of the upcoming heroes concept art. We know that the third one with the big ninja star is Kiriko and I‚Äôm pretty sure that the one with the wizard staff is Ramattra. But what about the others? If I had to guess I‚Äôd say the one on the left is maybe Sojourn? But on the right I‚Äôve got no idea (maybe Lifeweaver without the flower on his back but that‚Äôs a bit of a stretch) What do you all think? And has blizzard ever show us the original photos of these silhouettes?

I just redownloaded the game like 5 or six days ago and was barely able to complete the BP and all for free too. I already had 400 coins so I was able to unlock it by getting to the end. Normally I wouldn‚Äôt have subjected myself to this but the next BP looks WAYYY lamer and I didn‚Äôt want to miss out on some of the things I actually wanted in this one compared to the next one where I don‚Äôt like a single one of the skins. I did somewhere between 20-30 levels in the past 24 hours, I never want to touch stadium again and I NEED to touch some grass.

Also left with a flat 69 coins lol

I see nobody brings this up, so I decided to bring it here for visibility. 

Kiriko has been an iconic part of Overwatch 2 and these fox videos helped me pass the days of corona lockdown. So sad that this happened.

If we want the Overwatch movie to REALLY HAPPEN, we gotta get serious about our casting choices. No actors who fit or deserve the role, I want funny guy with name I remember. If we get this right, I‚Äôm thinking we can get at least 26% on rotten tomatoes. So who else are we casting?

(Thanks to u/R3MIX_19 for casting Chris Pratt as Wrecking Ball)
