2025-04-27 20:37:39,562 - INFO - Content: This is the best Overwatch has been in years and I’m tired of pretending it’s not


Yeah the launch of OW2 was a disaster, but I’m tired of having to pretend two years later that the game is still bad.

The current team of devs are significantly more ambitious and responsive to community woes than the OW1 team ever was. In just two seasons, the OW2 team has shown more willingness in shaking up the game and keeping it fresh than OW1 did in five years. Seriously, the only real shake-up OW1 got in that time was the introduction of role queue.

Now? Perks, hero bans, Stadium, map voting, etc. On top of that, the last four hero releases have been legitimately solid designs and great additions to the game. The game might not be what was promised, but the extent to which OW2 is a significantly better live service than OW1 needs to be studied.

Obviously the game still isn’t perfect, the monetization still sticks out as a sore point to me and I’d like to see them expand on the lore, but we’re a hell of a lot closer to that ideal now than we ever were back in the good old days.” I’m genuinely excited for the future of this game again.

To all the people that are complaining about Kiriko, Mercy, Rein getting all the skins, now it's time to act, now it's time to vote with your wallet.


Show the devs and shareholders that other heroes can also be profitable, show them that even if a hero is less popular there is still a chance to make money of it.

Especially if the skin is THAT good. I am not telling you to spend the money if you don't want to but if you are planning spending some this season maybe it's a good occasion.

I think making Sombra’s invisibility like Halo’s, where if you’re paying attention you’ll see it, would solve the issues that everyone has playing against her. She wouldn’t be banned so much and it would be a nerf yes but it could be mitigated by playing corners better.

2025-04-29 04:17:25,904 - INFO - Content: I built StadiumBuilds.io for my wife
Yesterday, I built a small app called StadiumBuilds.io. My wife plays a lot of Overwatch and has been getting into learning Moira Builds. She was frustrated because there was no real place to organize, share, or browse builds easily, so I decided to make something for her.

It was just supposed to be a small side project for fun. I hacked it together in about a day and showed it to her. She loved it and posted it in a Facebook group she is part of. Within 24 hours, we had over 25 users uploading and sharing their stadium builds. Some people even started sending suggestions, which I tried to implement as quickly as possible.

I honestly did not expect much. I just wanted to make something useful for her, but seeing it actually help other players too has been pretty cool. I am not trying to make money off it or anything. I just thought it was worth sharing because sometimes the small, personal projects end up being the ones people connect with the most.

If you want to check it out or share feedback, that would be awesome. I am still adding features and would love to hear what players actually want instead of guessing.

Thanks for reading.

Pretty much the title, but as a Sombra main, I see a lot of rework suggestions, and while I don't think she needs one, since she has gotten too much, I keep seeing rework suggestions that, at least in my eyes, misses the mark since they make her so drastically different from what she is now. So, how would you rework her without removing what makes her unique?

Side note, I know it's going to be mentioned, but removing her is not an option. Other than that, pretty much anything goes.

If I could keep scrolling, it would be more of the same. Zarya main, and I'm getting MVP most of these matches. This is debilitating. Always a soldier or reaper running off to the corners and dying.. I never seem to get the god reapers on my team. Maybe it's time to take a break.

I can get it when tank bans it's dps counter or supports don't want to play against an annoying flanker, but it's crazy when without knowing anything about me as a player second dps has the prejudice to judge my ability to utilize the charater that I came here to play.

And in general I really dislike how many people ban the characters that they don't want on their team instead of the characters they don't want to play against.

I've literally not seen this girl in any of my QP games Plat/Diamond and above. Or even last season before banning. I don't get it? And when I do happened to see her she tickles the team and then switches. Like she's in a pretty weak state right now where any decent supp player can shit on her. And yet every time I visit reddit there's a new thread about her. Am I playing a different game from everyone else orrr?

2025-04-29 17:14:17,469 - INFO - Content: Freja's launch has been Overshadowed, at least for me
Freja seems like a great addition to the Overwatch roster, but at least for me, the hype surrounding her release was the lowest I've felt for any new hero. 

With the massive launch of Stadium alongside her, I feel she kind of got overshadowed by all the marketing and hype pushing the new mode. Most new hero releases are the MAINSHOW about their seasons, but with Freja, she's more of a sideshow. 

Whenever I see a Freja in game, I just think "Oh yeah, Freja exists, forgot about that." Part of it is definitely that DPS is by far my least played role, but I still got really excited for Venture in season 10. 

I wonder if anyone else feels the same, that Stadium definitely took the hype away from Frejas release. This is absolutely not meant to be Freja hate by the way, think she is a fun and good addition to OW.

2025-04-29 23:14:02,874 - INFO - Content: New German Mercy lines appear to be AI.
We already know that Mercy's German actress quit her role for now, as long as Microsoft wants to use her voice data to train AI (though it seems like Blizz is already looking to replace her entirely). I just checked out the new Gundam stuff and Mercy's voice lines sound very much like they are AI. Soldier and Ramattra also have new voices but use actual voice actors. I assume the originals also quit.

If this keeps up then the German version of this game will slowly but surely lose its soul. I heard similar things are happening with other languages like French so I guess this is unfortunately not too surprising.

Very annoying that Season 16 doesn’t have anything like the Perked Up event. It was a good way to earn loot boxes—especially great since I live in a country where they’re banned and not in the battle pass. Total letdown.

2025-04-30 01:11:56,503 - INFO - Content: We were literally held hostage in Stadium
Got trapped in Stadium by the enemy team with 4 randoms against a 5-stack. They held us hostage in the match and said: “We won’t finish the game until one of you leaves.”

When we tried to go for the objective, they killed us, refused to capture it themselves, and just camped us in front of our base to farm us - over 10 - 15 minutes.

Why the hell is this kind of matchmaking even possible? We all reported them, but as always, nothing happens.

Who at Blizzard had the brain fart to match Gold players against Diamonds or even Masters? Who is supposed to enjoy these games? It’s absolutely infuriating. 
Either you steamroll the enemy without effort or you get steamrolled. Neither is fun. As soon as I’m done with the challenges, I’m done with this game mode. It had potential, but sadly, they’re just repeating the same mistakes from release.

So stadium mode, right? Pretty fun, enjoy playing it. 

But...

  
**Why does 76 have like multiple perks that give him auto aim. Auto aim rocket, auto aim after firing a rocket, extra auto aim during auto aim ult**

Like... idc if I'm low elo or just bad, but come on man. Playing dps in this gamemode is like pulling teeth. I can see why the queues for it are so quick compared to support and tank, which is insane to me. 

But just... soldier. It's so lame to play against and so boring to play as. Like if I wanted to have auto-aim all game I'd just get cheats.

Overt your eyes if easier startled as this is quite a dispicable topic.

Tracers weapon charm is only on one gun, why? She has two, does she like the right one more? Left doesn’t deserve swag? Seems abit rude the left gun just has to watch as the right one has more drip then him, justice for tracers left gun. Give my man a keychain already. Literally unplayable

2025-05-01 03:02:01,873 - INFO - Content: My ban strategy: Ban what your tank bans
Rather than banning what I think will counter me (non-tank) the hardest, I've started banning exactly what my tank bans. My rationale is that the tank knows what it has the hardest time playing against, and the tank is IMO the most important matchup. If I can give the tank the advantage it needs to win the matchup, I think it gives the team a better chance of winning.

Since I've started doing this I've gone 7-2. Small sample size, I know, but it does appear to be helping.

EDIT: 8-2  
EDIT2: 8-3, but my tank didn't pick any bans so I'm not counting it. Still 8-2  
EDIT3: 9-3

The truth is that Overwatch is at its peak, there has never been so much content, the player base is large and solid and the company, for the first time, is making an effort to listen to the community. Only those who live on nostalgia would deny this.

2025-05-02 04:44:01,618 - INFO - Content: Blizzard lets slip some gameplay metrics, showing that Overwatch saw ~15.6M hours spent in matches in the last week
Blizzard has a history of being extremely tight-lipped about their gameplay data. Player counts, hours spent in-game or in-match, etc. They've almost never made that data public, to my active memory. But from a recent tweet and dev blog post, some simple math shows some very decent numbers spent in-match (going purely off language, this doesn't seem to count time spent in menus or in queue).

2025-05-02 15:39:09,254 - INFO - Content: Please don’t get mad at your support for getting targeted
If they’re getting slammed by both dps every team fight and nobody helps, then they’re going to die. Everyone knows to target the supports, and those dps are gonna hunt and chase and they will outnumber and kill a healer who gets no assistance.

I understand not noticing a flank sneaking around you, or getting distracted, but if your support is consistently getting killed and asking you for help because they’re getting ganged up on, please don’t mock them for sucking at the game and continue to ignore the issue. No character survives getting ganged up on. If a support ignored a dps getting swarmed they’d get hate for not trying to save them, so why doesn’t it go both ways?!

Your supports cannot heal you if they’re dead, and they can’t keep healing you while also avoiding multiple enemies at once! Be a team player and don’t attack people for getting ganged up on. Help your teammates, don’t blame them!

This has been a psa from a frustrated healer tired of getting hunted down only to get called trash for not somehow surviving an entire team swooping down on my head when everyone else is decidedly not paying attention to where the enemies are. Thank you.

Edit: I know sometimes you need to switch characters to have better survivability - that’s not what this is about. In Stadium you CAN’T switch, and even switching doesn’t miraculously make your teamwork better, even if it helps a matchup. You still need to help your team, and saying they just need to switch is still ignoring their actual issue!

2025-05-02 16:45:43,586 - INFO - Content: My account got suspended, and I'm grateful for the learning opportunity.
I know the ban/suspension system in OW has been getting a lot of flak these days and some of it is warranted, but I thought I would share a personal growth story. 

My account got suspended last month after being reported for inappropriate communication. At first, much like anyone, I was shocked and a little angry. I immediately fired off an email demanding explanation for what my direct offense was. I was confident after seeing Blizzard's explanation. I would be able to smugly post a screenshot of the reasons they gave and be able to say, "BLIZZARD BANNED ME FOR NO REASON."

That was not the case. 

Blizzard had every god damn right to suspend my account. The few lines they posted from my texts chats that were reported, honestly made me really ashamed of myself for behaving such a way. Don't get me wrong, I've seen worse stuff said, I wasn't throwing out any slurs or anything. But in general, the language I used to describe players I deemed to be playing badly, was, frankly, unacceptable. 

What's even crazier is I don't even remember saying these things, and I don't even remember what was happening in these games to cause me to act such a way. I would never say these things to a person in real life. Heck, I barely every even get angry in the real world. The weird divide and shelter that anonymity of online provides, and the fact that you hear SO MUCH vitriol in OW, it really does normalize this behavior. It's so easy to fall victim to the "other people do it to me, so I'm going to dish it out, too" mentality. 

Honestly, I'm grateful for this ban because it really made me take a look at myself in the mirror and realize I was part of the problem, too. 

I know this will likely fall on deaf ears, since toxicity in the gaming community will never go away, but I'd like to think I've grown from this experience, and It's made me a better OW community member. 

I know the ban system isn't perfect, but I urge you, if you're getting banned or suspended because of your behavior, take a moment to examine yourself critically. Use it as an opportunity to learn and grow. 

*Edit*: I’m not going to repeat what I said. I’m ashamed in myself enough that I even said it the first time. It was inappropriate and the suspension was warranty. That’s all that really matters in the context of this post.

Honestly, I'm grateful for this ban because it really made me take a look at myself in the mirror and realize I was part of the problem, too. 

I know this will likely fall on deaf ears, since toxicity in the gaming community will never go away, but I'd like to think I've grown from this experience, and It's made me a better OW community member. 

I know the ban system isn't perfect, but I urge you, if you're getting banned or suspended because of your behavior, take a moment to examine yourself critically. Use it as an opportunity to learn and grow. 

*Edit*: I’m not going to repeat what I said. I’m ashamed in myself enough that I even said it the first time. It was inappropriate and the suspension was warranty. That’s all that really matters in the context of this post.

Does anyone know how big OW is in Japan? I see a lot of japanese streamers on twitch but that is obviously a bit anecdotal.

So basically I begged my friend to play ow with me and he installed. Out of all the characters he tried the one he likes most is lw because he has “good shooting range” I honestly have no clue why he likes him so much. I told him to try soldier as he should be easier for him to use (cause he does shooting games) but nope he insta locks lw. Obv we only play in quick play and he always gets the most kills but like 300 healing 😭. Why am I typing this? Idk I just feel like it’s so odd 😭😭😭. Anyways have a good day/night

2025-05-03 09:14:13,781 - INFO - Content: Hero 45 is a gladiator!
My wishes are being granted. As a Roman myself I’ve always wanted a gladiator hero, or at least an Italian one. When I noticed these teasers in the new Stadium map I went crazy. Not only I’m getting a gladiator hero, but it’s a “she” too (I prefer female characters)! I can understand it’s a female since “La lupa” means “The wolf” but in the singular FEMININE conjugation. Also La Lupa is a very important mythological creature for Rome since she caught Romulus and Remus, founders of Rome, from the Tiber river when they where still babies and gave them milk, you can find her symbol all around Rome. I’m feeling so represented omg
