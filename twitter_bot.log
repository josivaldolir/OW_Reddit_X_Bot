2025-02-22 15:13:21,017 - INFO - Content: The loot boxes and perks definitely make the game feel better.
I've gone from playing only when a friend hit me up for some matches, which could be once or twice a week, to playing a few matches nearly every day.

The loot boxes are nice simply because fashion is the endgame of any live service game worth it's salt. If I'm gonna be dping the same shit hundreds or thousands of times I wanna do it in *style*, dammit. And the LBs giving me a bunch of cosmetics definitely helps.

But the perks? Hooo boy. The perks add some spice to an already fast & flashy combat experience. Just going into fights and never being exactly sure what the opponent is going to be capable of, and you being able to surprise them as well, is so damned fun. Had absolute curb stomp games turned on their heads when people's perks came online. Some more impactful than others, yes, but plenty of surprises to be had. Torb sticking turrets onto ceilings? Mauga setting people on fire with his stomp? Kiriko throwing out healing every time she lands a kunai? Genji having goddamned lifesteal on Dragon Blade?

Yeah. It's been fun. Some of these perks need to be changed but it's mostly been a good time.
