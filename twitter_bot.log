2025-02-22 15:13:21,017 - INFO - Content: The loot boxes and perks definitely make the game feel better.
I've gone from playing only when a friend hit me up for some matches, which could be once or twice a week, to playing a few matches nearly every day.

The loot boxes are nice simply because fashion is the endgame of any live service game worth it's salt. If I'm gonna be dping the same shit hundreds or thousands of times I wanna do it in *style*, dammit. And the LBs giving me a bunch of cosmetics definitely helps.

But the perks? Hooo boy. The perks add some spice to an already fast & flashy combat experience. Just going into fights and never being exactly sure what the opponent is going to be capable of, and you being able to surprise them as well, is so damned fun. Had absolute curb stomp games turned on their heads when people's perks came online. Some more impactful than others, yes, but plenty of surprises to be had. Torb sticking turrets onto ceilings? Mauga setting people on fire with his stomp? Kiriko throwing out healing every time she lands a kunai? Genji having goddamned lifesteal on Dragon Blade?

Yeah. It's been fun. Some of these perks need to be changed but it's mostly been a good time.

Had a game where the enemy team’s dps swapped to symmetra and Mei to help counter my tank (sigma). Made sense to me cuz we were absolutely rolling them and if they didn’t find a way to mow down our tank we were gonna have a first point victory. They swapped and started rolling us. My tank swapped to Zar to counter their Dva and not be weak to beam users. (In my opinion - smart)

Well the other team got salty cuz the swap instantly stopped the one sided beat down again.

As a personal victory I told their supports to hush and then aced. I was reaper the whole game.

2025-02-22 18:17:37,942 - INFO - Content: Is it worth it to counter-switch now that you also lose perk progression?
Perks have been out for a good few days now, and I was wondering how this changes the whole "Counterwatch" gameplay.

I'm not sure if it was intentionally or not, but now once your character has progressed a couple levels, you're essentially hard locked into them. When switching heroes, you lose all perk progression. Now, especially if you've already unlocked a major perk, you're at risk for a major nerf when switching heroes after a few minutes into the game. Of course though, it also allows you to choose perks throughout the game that may not keep you hard-countered if you were previously having trouble.

This is certainly an interesting change that drastically effects the gameplay. How often do you swap heroes now? Under what conditions do you do so, if ever?

Kill the supports. Don't shoot a zarya when there 2 supports pocketing her.

Don't miss all shots on an echo with a non moving support on the ground.

Why do people still not know to kill them.

2025-02-23 07:35:04,958 - INFO - Content: Mics are useless in ow2
People always say that overwatch is a team game but in reality (especially in low ranks) it feels much more solo. I decided to get a mic awhile back and so far it's been almost useless, because everyone has their voice chat disabled and even if people has in enabled they don't communicate. So I've come to the conclusion that most people that are in "elo hell" is because of lack of communication in their lobbies (along with various other reasons people come up with).

I think I found the best way of doing zenyattas weapon, making something that could be dull into something way more fun.
And it’s do to each ball as an element with a unique kill effect depending on which ball does the final blow. The florist could be zen doing a roulette by spinning his balls to get a random one:

Depending on which is the last ball, the kill effect will be…

Fire- The enemy turns into a blaze

Water- the enemy turns into a pool of water 

Snow- the enemy turns into ice (like meis ult)

Rock- the enemy turns to stone and crumbles 

Lightning- the enemy is zapped 

Time- the enemy turns into dust 

Force- the enemy gets shot into the atmosphere

Darkness- the enemy turns black

I got the 9.99 starter pack (the 1000 coins and the skin) on my account. My husband got it on his as well but I have my paypal attached to his xbox (we share our funds anyways lol). But it cost $10.83. Not really a huge difference but I can’t think of any reason it would cost more? It says the same exact thing was purchased. Just wondering why that would happen and where that extra dollar went lol

Mine was my Reinhardt said I wasnt healing him. I was playing Brig. I was using 1 or 2 packs on him when needed and always procked my inspire (they had Dva so my inspire was up most of the game) I explained to him that Brig is not supposed to heal tank all the time her job is to keep squishies safe. I also had the second highest healing right after my friend who was playing Kiriko. Yet he started throwing. He said I needed to apologise and start healing him if I wanted him to stop throwing. Which I obviously didnt apologise. I know numbers aren't everything but even before throwing he had the most deaths and lowest elims and had the weirdest positioning. I know for a Rein elims are not gonna be high but I would expect Rein to have less deaths than average. This was a Diamond lobby btw. Even in Diamond some people dont seem to understand how Brig works. Did you guys ever had a player throwing for the dumbest reason?

I'm a mystery hero enjoyer, there I said it, I admit it. Since OW2 started, I've spent prob 30% of my game time in mystery heroes and I know there's a fairly large community for it. And I love the new perks system and have been grinding quite a bit this season in all modes. 

What is yalls opinion on the state of MH since perks?  For me, it's made me not want to play MH because perks reset upon death. It's like dangling the carrot in front of us, but we can hardly ever partake.  

I hope they add some special rules for mystery heroes that makes perks part of the average game. Until then I'm sticking with comp and qp.

Check it out now: [https://perks.owldle.com/](https://perks.owldle.com/)   
  
Guess the right perk given its icon and four possible answers. The game also features different difficulty modes (which can be found in the settings menu on the top right) like a hard mode, where you have to guess the exact perk name.   
  
If you have any feedback, please let me know! I plan to add more updates and difficulty settings and a potential score system overhaul soon.

She is in, and I **do not** exaggerate -- nearly absolutely every single match I play.  
She completely dominates in every single match she's in. The only exception is if the enemy has a better Soj.  
And because she's so absurd, pocketing her is basically mandatory, meaning now Mercy is almost a must-pick.  

&nbsp;  


She's so gamebreakingly overtuned it's not funny. This shit is not fun. It's just fucking exhausting.

In case you don't know what the hell Marvel ruins is, it's a universe where everything went wrong, very, VERY wrong. 

For example:

The punisher died on his first night as a vigilante

Magneto cant control is powers and died when tons of meta were flying at him

When the spider bit Peter, instead of giving him powers, it gave him an incurable disease that killed him slowly and agonizingly. 

Instead of becoming Hulk, Bruce became a mass of tumors who died in pain and suffering.

You get the point

Something not so crazy that I can see happening is that Talon didn't manage to completely brainwash Widow, and when she killed her husband, the pain and agony of what she had done made her end her own life right then and there, who knows, maybe after dressing her dead husband with the clothes he wore for their weeding, whie she uses her weeding dress, what do you think?

(Please don't take it to serious, it was the result of a fun gaming night)

I was playing Overwatch with a friend (non-player) and they asked me why Orisa is not wearing anything. After the first confusion and their explanation it kinda clicked.

Zenyatta is an Omnic, wears clothes
Ramattra is an Omnic, wears clothes
B.O.B wears clothes and a fancy hat
While Bastion too isn't wearing anything, they aren't sentinent in a "human" way (And in OW2 have the cap) 

Most the Omnics in the maps or official media also wear clothes. 

So why not Orisa?

*Tracer* and *Genji* are still [the only two heroes with increased base movement speed](https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki/Movement_speed) **(+8.7% faster)**. 

Why are they not using this for some other heroes? They never touch movement speed when it comes to balancing. They could use this to buff / nerf heroes in other ways than just changing damage and CD numbers.

^(Personally, I wouldn't mind if venture got the increased movement speed... but who am I to judge balancing.)

2025-02-25 11:12:28,629 - INFO - Content: payload maps are the backbone of Overwatch.
I only get hyped for comp when I see a payload map, perhaps it’s the nostalgia of the og payload maps but I also love the new payload maps? Hate playing push maps. There is no order, it’s just all chaos, everyone feeds, there’s too many angles. Just never feels as fun as a payload map where you’re on the cart holding it for you life, especially in overtime. The spawn points aren’t as far (ahem… ignoring numbani second point). with push it just feels like I spend half the game walking back to the fight. Just not an enjoyable game mode. Flashpoint is chill and I dearly miss 2cp 🫶🏼

2025-02-25 13:42:26,780 - INFO - Content: To Metal Rank players that have Tracer on their team
**Tracer is not a backline assassin** unless she is smurfing or mechanically superior to everyone else in the lobby. The 4k backline wipe Tracer is more often than not a fantasy and not what you should expect in your games (especially not metal ranks...!)

Her job is to take angles that deny the enemy team positions. Essentially, she herds everyone together and if they disrespect her, they die. Once the enemies are grouped up, they're typically in less ideal positions that your team can more easily capitalize on, and she'll play off that from the angle. That's when you see her get a ton of kills.

She is not like Widow, Sojourn, Junkrat, etc., who get immediate and obvious value. There's set up, patience, and ability tracking on her end. 

**ALSO**

By nature of taking up close 1v1s, Tracer doesn't have the luxury of spamming damage across the map. So yes, she can still be contributing with 5k damage if your Soldier has 10k. 

**Tl;dr:** I've been flamed consistently if we lose the first fight as I relearn this character on mouse and keyboard.

i like witch mercy, i think the skin still holds up years later and i like the recolour too. you can also see it's influence in the widowmaker mythic, which i think is another point to how iconic it is.
