(Commissioner here! Hi, I love Illari and decided she deserved one of my ideas come to life via an artist I commissioned :}
She's meant to be quite larger that the milky ways? Awwhr I know she may never get a mythic but I love her)

"When the galaxy shattered, she rose not as Illari, but as Lightwrought."

After the fall of Starwatch, Illari was remade by celestial forces into a radiant mythic beingâ€”forged to restore balance where even the stars failed. She carries Earth in her weapon, constellations in her veins, and the burden of the light itself.

Mei has been my favorite heroe since 2016,  I was surprised yesterday when I was watching a Championship match that some player picked her, is she meta?

I got almost everything in the picture as gifts (I bought the mug haha), if you have anything Mei related, SHOW ME! (Please, hehe).

P.S. Obviously not a native english speaker, don't roast me (yet, feel free to correct my grammar respectfully).
