2025-04-27 20:37:39,562 - INFO - Content: This is the best Overwatch has been in years and I’m tired of pretending it’s not


Yeah the launch of OW2 was a disaster, but I’m tired of having to pretend two years later that the game is still bad.

The current team of devs are significantly more ambitious and responsive to community woes than the OW1 team ever was. In just two seasons, the OW2 team has shown more willingness in shaking up the game and keeping it fresh than OW1 did in five years. Seriously, the only real shake-up OW1 got in that time was the introduction of role queue.

Now? Perks, hero bans, Stadium, map voting, etc. On top of that, the last four hero releases have been legitimately solid designs and great additions to the game. The game might not be what was promised, but the extent to which OW2 is a significantly better live service than OW1 needs to be studied.

Obviously the game still isn’t perfect, the monetization still sticks out as a sore point to me and I’d like to see them expand on the lore, but we’re a hell of a lot closer to that ideal now than we ever were back in the good old days.” I’m genuinely excited for the future of this game again.

To all the people that are complaining about Kiriko, Mercy, Rein getting all the skins, now it's time to act, now it's time to vote with your wallet.


Show the devs and shareholders that other heroes can also be profitable, show them that even if a hero is less popular there is still a chance to make money of it.

Especially if the skin is THAT good. I am not telling you to spend the money if you don't want to but if you are planning spending some this season maybe it's a good occasion.

I think making Sombra’s invisibility like Halo’s, where if you’re paying attention you’ll see it, would solve the issues that everyone has playing against her. She wouldn’t be banned so much and it would be a nerf yes but it could be mitigated by playing corners better.

2025-04-29 04:17:25,904 - INFO - Content: I built StadiumBuilds.io for my wife
Yesterday, I built a small app called StadiumBuilds.io. My wife plays a lot of Overwatch and has been getting into learning Moira Builds. She was frustrated because there was no real place to organize, share, or browse builds easily, so I decided to make something for her.

It was just supposed to be a small side project for fun. I hacked it together in about a day and showed it to her. She loved it and posted it in a Facebook group she is part of. Within 24 hours, we had over 25 users uploading and sharing their stadium builds. Some people even started sending suggestions, which I tried to implement as quickly as possible.

I honestly did not expect much. I just wanted to make something useful for her, but seeing it actually help other players too has been pretty cool. I am not trying to make money off it or anything. I just thought it was worth sharing because sometimes the small, personal projects end up being the ones people connect with the most.

If you want to check it out or share feedback, that would be awesome. I am still adding features and would love to hear what players actually want instead of guessing.

Thanks for reading.

Pretty much the title, but as a Sombra main, I see a lot of rework suggestions, and while I don't think she needs one, since she has gotten too much, I keep seeing rework suggestions that, at least in my eyes, misses the mark since they make her so drastically different from what she is now. So, how would you rework her without removing what makes her unique?

Side note, I know it's going to be mentioned, but removing her is not an option. Other than that, pretty much anything goes.

If I could keep scrolling, it would be more of the same. Zarya main, and I'm getting MVP most of these matches. This is debilitating. Always a soldier or reaper running off to the corners and dying.. I never seem to get the god reapers on my team. Maybe it's time to take a break.

I can get it when tank bans it's dps counter or supports don't want to play against an annoying flanker, but it's crazy when without knowing anything about me as a player second dps has the prejudice to judge my ability to utilize the charater that I came here to play.

And in general I really dislike how many people ban the characters that they don't want on their team instead of the characters they don't want to play against.

I've literally not seen this girl in any of my QP games Plat/Diamond and above. Or even last season before banning. I don't get it? And when I do happened to see her she tickles the team and then switches. Like she's in a pretty weak state right now where any decent supp player can shit on her. And yet every time I visit reddit there's a new thread about her. Am I playing a different game from everyone else orrr?

2025-04-29 17:14:17,469 - INFO - Content: Freja's launch has been Overshadowed, at least for me
Freja seems like a great addition to the Overwatch roster, but at least for me, the hype surrounding her release was the lowest I've felt for any new hero. 

With the massive launch of Stadium alongside her, I feel she kind of got overshadowed by all the marketing and hype pushing the new mode. Most new hero releases are the MAINSHOW about their seasons, but with Freja, she's more of a sideshow. 

Whenever I see a Freja in game, I just think "Oh yeah, Freja exists, forgot about that." Part of it is definitely that DPS is by far my least played role, but I still got really excited for Venture in season 10. 

I wonder if anyone else feels the same, that Stadium definitely took the hype away from Frejas release. This is absolutely not meant to be Freja hate by the way, think she is a fun and good addition to OW.

2025-04-29 23:14:02,874 - INFO - Content: New German Mercy lines appear to be AI.
We already know that Mercy's German actress quit her role for now, as long as Microsoft wants to use her voice data to train AI (though it seems like Blizz is already looking to replace her entirely). I just checked out the new Gundam stuff and Mercy's voice lines sound very much like they are AI. Soldier and Ramattra also have new voices but use actual voice actors. I assume the originals also quit.

If this keeps up then the German version of this game will slowly but surely lose its soul. I heard similar things are happening with other languages like French so I guess this is unfortunately not too surprising.

Very annoying that Season 16 doesn’t have anything like the Perked Up event. It was a good way to earn loot boxes—especially great since I live in a country where they’re banned and not in the battle pass. Total letdown.

2025-04-30 01:11:56,503 - INFO - Content: We were literally held hostage in Stadium
Got trapped in Stadium by the enemy team with 4 randoms against a 5-stack. They held us hostage in the match and said: “We won’t finish the game until one of you leaves.”

When we tried to go for the objective, they killed us, refused to capture it themselves, and just camped us in front of our base to farm us - over 10 - 15 minutes.

Why the hell is this kind of matchmaking even possible? We all reported them, but as always, nothing happens.

Who at Blizzard had the brain fart to match Gold players against Diamonds or even Masters? Who is supposed to enjoy these games? It’s absolutely infuriating. 
Either you steamroll the enemy without effort or you get steamrolled. Neither is fun. As soon as I’m done with the challenges, I’m done with this game mode. It had potential, but sadly, they’re just repeating the same mistakes from release.

So stadium mode, right? Pretty fun, enjoy playing it. 

But...

  
**Why does 76 have like multiple perks that give him auto aim. Auto aim rocket, auto aim after firing a rocket, extra auto aim during auto aim ult**

Like... idc if I'm low elo or just bad, but come on man. Playing dps in this gamemode is like pulling teeth. I can see why the queues for it are so quick compared to support and tank, which is insane to me. 

But just... soldier. It's so lame to play against and so boring to play as. Like if I wanted to have auto-aim all game I'd just get cheats.

Overt your eyes if easier startled as this is quite a dispicable topic.

Tracers weapon charm is only on one gun, why? She has two, does she like the right one more? Left doesn’t deserve swag? Seems abit rude the left gun just has to watch as the right one has more drip then him, justice for tracers left gun. Give my man a keychain already. Literally unplayable

2025-05-01 03:02:01,873 - INFO - Content: My ban strategy: Ban what your tank bans
Rather than banning what I think will counter me (non-tank) the hardest, I've started banning exactly what my tank bans. My rationale is that the tank knows what it has the hardest time playing against, and the tank is IMO the most important matchup. If I can give the tank the advantage it needs to win the matchup, I think it gives the team a better chance of winning.

Since I've started doing this I've gone 7-2. Small sample size, I know, but it does appear to be helping.

EDIT: 8-2  
EDIT2: 8-3, but my tank didn't pick any bans so I'm not counting it. Still 8-2  
EDIT3: 9-3
