It's always ''doom switch''. If my DPS are both doing really poorly and dying too much, it's only because they have no shield tank apparently. I got called the r word and a ''doom bot'' because I didn't switch to Zarya at a random's request. And also that I should switch because with Doom we have ''3 dps''. I legit enjoy the character and want to win but this is getting ridiculous.

2025-03-03 21:13:40,973 - INFO - Content: Overwatch doesn‚Äôt do enough to stop downrankers/smurfs
For reference, I‚Äôm gold. Im pretty comfortable with the idea that I suck, but I play to have fun, so whatever.

I just got out of a match with a fairly obvious Smurf account in a 5 stack who spent the match on sojourn with a mercy pocket and absolutely annihilated my entire team over and over. By the end of the game, they had 100 eliminations and the closest on my team was about 17 or 18. 

Then, just when we were about to lose, they‚Äôd all stand back off point and let us cap, just to drag the game out longer. They let it go all the way to the 4th round then c9ed and let us take the win. 

They plugged a twitch account at the end of the match and their stream title was ‚Äòbronze account smurfing‚Äô

They wasted 40 minutes of our lives, and even if the account gets banned, they can make another one with a 2$ sim card from a petrol station and rinse and repeat. I‚Äôm frustrated and I feel that this is one of the main reasons the game is dying.
