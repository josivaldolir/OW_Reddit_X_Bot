2025-03-09 10:38:33,713 - INFO - Content: Where am I supposed to practice if not Quick Play?
The past couple days I've been working on practicing Symmetra. I adored her in OW1 but her new playstyle since the rework has never really clicked with me. 

I don't really have any DPS characters I play well, so I've been trying to practice Symm to just get a feel of how she works and try to really put in the effort to learn her new kit. 

Admittedly, it hasn't been going great. I do struggle a lot. I die a lot. I don't always deal the most damage. I don't always get the most value. There's a lot to consider with her kit and it's more than I'm used to.

I've been getting flamed by teammates and even opponents. Today in a game the enemy tank kept saying how I may as well have been helping his team win, and my team was joining in saying how awful I had been playing.

It was Quick Play, though. Where else am I supposed to practice a hero if not in Quick Play? Am I doing something wrong by playing subpar in that mode?

When is the mid season patch so they can put that old man in his grave. Like my team will be winning and then boom Torb. It’s no more point for us. 300-400 heath. Turret that hits like a truck… that also has the dps passive for whatever fucking reason. He has no fall off. His damage is crazy. The perk being able to put his turret on a wall was the biggest mistake they possibly could’ve done. It’s just like the Illari situation but with damage. I’m just wondering why no one is talking about how annoying it is to play against him.

2025-03-09 16:13:33,812 - INFO - Content: We put our differences aside for a group photo because the game wouldn’t give us a second support in QP
Started a quickplay match yesterday and almost immediately saw one of the other team’s support players leave the match. Then the game just kinda…didn’t give them a replacement.

I’ve seen this happen a few times recently, and it looks like it’s a bug. Felt pretty unfair to keep at it as a 5v4, so we all took the opportunity to take a group photo. Watching everyone organize for the pic in text chat was great.

See, OW2 isn’t toxic ALL the time!

Photo credit goes to the other team’s Sombra, King!

2025-03-09 23:35:16,882 - INFO - Content: In my opinion Ramattra "rework" should come back as selectable perk.
When Ramattra was reworked they changed punching through shield with a destorying shield faster. While it was really dissapointing for most of the community, in my opinion it should come back as selectable perk.

I am thinking about it mostly because of Zarya, as Ramattra was able to destroy her bubble in 2 punches. Selectable minor perk that turns him into her counter would be IMO fun and flexible idea. But it's not only about Zarya, if we increase numbers a bit it could be good counter to for example Winston who bubbles your team very randomly.

To sum up, while the heck not? Let me choose between punching for better self offence and weaker punching that is more team oriented.

I'm so sick of post game banter being removed from the game. 
Listen, I get it, some people don't want to be exposed to trash talk. However, I don't do that. I love friendly banter, I thrive talking to both my team mates and enemy's about our game. 

For players that do not want to he exposed to Randoms on the internet, you can Mute or Leave chat, we have options for you. 

I find it insulting that everyone is universally told they cannot talk about the match after the match. I get so worked up and angry when I try to type something, but I cannot finish in time and things get left unsaid or unfinished. It's the cause of more keyboard smashes for me, than losing rounds. 

Anyone else want the post match chat back?

When I play QP, I have a blast. I feel like I'm somewhat evenly matched and if I lose, no big deal. Rarely do I find toxic people. Most people are chill.

When I play comp, I have a terrible time. Every match is either a nail-biter or a stomp (against me). I feel like I am outclassed by the people in the lobby. I get flamed and have to deal with toxics way more than chill people.

Anyone else feel the same?

2025-03-10 12:29:49,674 - INFO - Content: The downside to projectile sizes that no one talks about
As a hitscan enjoyer, I was neutral to the projectile size changes when they were first announced. Sure, it means you have to be slightly less accurate to land shots, but that’s not really a major downside, even for aim purists. Given how fast everyone moves in this game, having more hit consistency isn’t necessarily a bad thing.

However, the downside that often gets overlooked is how some character models and animations position their hands in front of their heads—examples include but not limited to: Kiriko while throwing Kunais, Ana while shooting, Echo while using abilities, and even Moira during Coalescence. Because the projectile size is now larger, these hand/arm animations can obstruct headshots, causing shots that would've previously hit the head to register on a limb instead, resulting in significantly less damage.

This is particularly bad for heroes like Cass, who rely almost exclusively on headshots to win duels. With the current projectile size buff, I’m convinced it punishes precision players more than it helps them. Rather than rewarding accuracy, it creates situations where well-placed shots are unintentionally blocked by animation quirks—leading to fewer confirmed kills for players who aim well. I know this is anecdotal now as I've only noticed it in game, but I'll find and post examples when i have time if anyone's interested.

There will be recolors of the first collab for all five Heroes. Apparently you can earn the Junkrat Legendary again. Obviously new dance emotes (guessing an extra Ramattra one since it was teased in the Reddit AMA). And for everybody asking how Bob will look like: We already have seen a glimpse of him in the Music Video shared in 2023 where he is dressed as a Bodyguard. The Members of Le Sserafim choose who gets the Skins.

sojourn deserves proper skins.

the dokiwatch theme lends itself to cute concepts.

it is reminiscent of the star guardian and stellar protector series in league of legends/paladins.

So many skins are about completely changing the heroes' look and basically turning them into something else entirely (mostly mythological figures).

But it feels like it's been so long since we've just had... the heroes just being themselves in a cool outfit ? Not Mercy as an evil witch or the entire east asian pantheon, just Anzela Ziegler dressing up to look sharp. The last time we've got something like this was probably the formal skins last christmas, or the last k-pop collab.

The streetwear/hypebeast theme looks so cool too, it's a shame it's only been used for 2 collabs so far, and is basically restricted to females heroes because of it.

^^Also ^^it ^^would ^^be ^^the ^^perfect ^^occasion ^^for ^^a ^^lucio ^^mythic

just a fun thread. Think of what your absolute favourite non-Overwatch IP, character or brand that would make you scream in excitement if they got a skin! 

Personally, I have been very against collabs until now. knowing there are other characters or series I'd actually care about getting a collab in Overwatch would get me buying instantly. really helped me come to peace with the idea and now I'm brainstorming what I want to see! atm the only characters that got a collab that are genuinely liked characters myself are sylvanas and ochaco. i missed those because of my personal vendetta against the idea apart from Lesserafim, but will probably wait for future collabs to see who will come next.

Aaaanyway, that vent is over. now for the fun part!

Sanrio characters: Kuromi is my Spirit animal, would buy a skin based on her and cherish it so much! My Melody and Cinnamoroll too! thankfully those characters seem likely if Sanrio collabed. 

Bionicle: will never happen probs, but heroes getting skins based on the 6 toa tribes would be sweeeeeet. my childhood and favourite toyline ever!

Is there any IPs you adore dearly and mean lots to you that you'd love to see?  Which characters?

Hello!

You might recognize me as the guy who made the comic "HAPPY NATION" ( https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1gpf9rx/happy_nation_the_first_comic_of_mine_that_takes/ )
and I RETURN!

This next issue is in full color, as a lot of people previously mentioned how they wanted to see my work in color as opposed to the black/white/red theming I had going on.

I'm almost done coloring the comic and then putting in dialogue, which will probably take me another couple weeks. But I wanted to show that l'm almost done, and that l've still got more down the pipeline. I look forward to showing you all the full issue, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised as to what's inside and what's coming! :)

DM eats projectiles right? Well, I say class Invisible Sombra as a projectile and let Dva eat her. The enemy Sombra can't respawn as they have been completely disintegrated down to the molecular level.

I think this would be a good balance change, as it increases the risk for Sombra to go Invisible.

I swear like 9 times out of 10 whenever I queue for all roles, I get put in as a tank. The daily challenge for 'a classy flex' might as well just say play tank 3x, because that's what ends up happening. do yall also have this experience or is it just me?

I find it amusing and insightful to see what people were saying about certain ideas in OW back in the day. Has the experience of the player base changed affected this opinion? Or was it the game that changed too much? Maybe a little bit of both?

So I m curious who are u going to Ban most (except widow we all saw it coming).


For me personally I will always vote for zarya no matter what role I play she is the most "counter watch" hero in the game and I find her more annoying to deal with than doom and mauga.
